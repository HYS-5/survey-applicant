Digital Twin (DT) technology offers promising capabilities for real-time safety monitoring through virtual replicas of physical systems. However, existing DT frameworks rarely integrate comprehensive safety monitoring via a centralized model consolidation mechanism, such as Federated Learning (FL), which is explicitly tailored for multi-worker scenarios. Addressing this challenge, this paper proposes a FL-based Safety Monitoring Digital Twin (SMDT) framework designed to enhance multi-worker safety in resource-constrained settings.

The analysis incorporates alternative future scenarios to depict potential emissions trajectories contingent upon the effectiveness of policy implementation. The study utilises comprehensive data from the Estonian Building Registry—one of the earliest examples of a national digital twin—encompassing the whole residential building stock.

Currently, the industry has the capacity to operate at BIM Maturity stage 2 but faces challenges in achieving seamless data integration and interoperability. Progressing toward BIM Maturity Stage 3 could benefit from adopting semantic web and linked data technologies, which enable a more structured, machine-readable data environment. However, the path to this level of integration remains complex. At the heart of the semantic web lies ontologies, playing a pivotal role in structuring domain knowledge. Therefore, through a systematic literature review, this study explores the integration of ontologies and semantic web technologies in BIM or Digital Twin environments for construction management. This study provides a trend and theoretical analysis under different construction management use cases to identify how ontologies and semantic web technologies have been utilised during the construction execution phase. The study identified eight different use cases, including safety management, compliance checking, and construction planning and production control, among others. The findings emphasise that while there is great potential in using ontologies and the semantic web for data integration, significant barriers remain, such as data privacy concerns, scalability issues, and the complexity of ontology mapping. These findings underscore the importance of addressing these challenges to fully harness the capabilities of semantic web technologies within BIM environments, providing a potential roadmap toward realising BIM Maturity Stage 3 and to enhance collaboration and data exchange in the construction industry.

We introduce a pioneering, four-tiered hierarchical productivity framework to respond to these challenges. This innovative approach integrates operational, tactical, strategic, and normative layers. At its core, the framework applies standardised, repeatable process steps—mapped using Value Stream Mapping (VSM)—to capture key indicators such as input efficiency, output effectiveness, and First-Time Quality (FTQ).

In view of the rapid development of computational technologies, it's becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the urgent need to accelerate the intelligent development of dam safety monitoring systems. The emphasis of the prior studies usually lay in the dam safety monitoring data and structural health analysis. However, they neglect the importance of the real-time interactions of the systems, which makes the presented work not suitable for today's digital age. As such, based on digital twin platform, this paper aims to propose a visualization system for dam safety monitoring. Primarily, the next-generation and real-time rendering technologies are introduced to construct digital twin platform. The digital twin platform serves as a digital sand table to accurately reflect the dam current state and real-time monitoring information. Subsequently, artificial intelligence algorithms and numerical simulation are applied in monitoring data analysis, prediction model construction, structural safety evaluation, and risk early warning.

However, monitoring systems lack mechanical analysis models and fail to predict and control construction risks. Additionally, the foundation pit model could not be updated based on on-site observed data, leading to inaccurate predictions. This study proposes a DT modeling framework for foundation pits, which is used to simulate, predict, and control the risks associated with the entire excavation process. Consequently, based on the DT modeling framework, a DT foundation pit model (DTFPM) was established using modeling and updating algorithms. This study summarizes and identifies the key modeling parameters of foundation pits. A parametric modeling algorithm based on ABAQUS (v2020) was developed to drive the excavation pit modeling process within seconds. Furthermore, an inverse analysis optimization algorithm based on genetic algorithms (GA) and real-time observed deformation was employed to update the elastic modulus of the soil. The algorithm supports parallel computing and can converge within 10 generations. The prediction error of the model after inverse analysis can be reduced to within 10%. Finally, the authors applied DTFPM to establish an intelligent monitoring system. The focus is on real-time and predictive warnings based on the monitoring deformation of the current construction step and the updated model.

In this paper, we apply digital twin (DT) technology to the FCST process for the first time. We firstly design an architecture of DT-enabled FCST including four layers to support further development. Then, we present a triangular mesh alignment-based angle measurement (TMA-AM) algorithm to efficiently collect deflection angle data for DT-enabled FCST. Extensive experiments conducted on a aircraft wing subassembly platform show that the TMA-AM algorithm achieves an average angular measurement error of less than 0.1°, outperforming existing methods. Moreover, we develop a virtual experimental platform named DT-FCST aligned with a real aircraft wing subassembly platform. In addition, TMA-AM algorithm is integrated with the DT-FCST platform. By integrating real-time data from the cockpit, real-time physical-virtual interaction of aircraft control sticks and flight control surfaces are achieved, ensuring consistency between physical and virtual movements.

Unlike the data-rich environments typical of structure-from-motion (sfm) technologies, the construction phase of civil engineering projects often faces economic constraints that limit data collection. This results in sporadic and localized snapshots, rather than comprehensive spatial and temporal coverage of the entire scene. Such prevalent data sparsity poses significant challenges to achieving accurate image localization. Our research is tailored to address this specific challenge, focusing on single image localization in environments where data is inherently sparse. We introduce a multi-scale convolutional attention network, incorporating feature-fused adversarial components, to effectively navigate the complexities of sparse data typical in civil engineering construction sites. The network employs large kernel convolutions for refined channel and spatial attention, ensuring precise location information transmission, even in data-limited scenarios.

The adoption of Building Digital Twins (BDT) in the construction site is a promising solution to this issue, by automating data acquisition and knowledge extraction processes and providing what-if scenario simulation capabilities. Furthermore, the current research sets the principles to define, replicate, and scale-up the architecture of a Building Digital Twin Platform (BDTP), conceived as a scalar ecosystem, which allows to seamlessly manage on-site construction processes, integrating cross-cutting domains for the construction site optimization (Progress monitoring, Quality control, Operational Health and Safety, Equipment control, and Production planning). The starting point of the research is a comprehensive diagnosis of on-site process inefficiencies and the barriers to its digitalization leading to the user requirements, which have been underpinned by questionnaires and interviews addressed within an open innovation user-centered approach around Living Labs.

Heavy construction equipment and workers are often required to work in limited workspaces simultaneously. Struck-by accidents resulting from poor worker and equipment interactions account for a large proportion of accidents and fatalities on construction sites. The emerging technologies based on computer vision and artificial intelligence offer an opportunity to enhance construction safety through advanced monitoring utilizing site cameras. A crucial pre-requisite to the development of safety monitoring applications is the ability to identify accurately and localize the position of the equipment and its critical components in 3D space. This study proposes a workflow for excavator 3D pose estimation based on deep learning using RGB images. In the proposed workflow, an articulated 3D digital twin of an excavator is used to generate the necessary data for training a 3D pose estimation model.

For this purpose, we acquire RGB images of the individual stones and of the wall during the construction phase. In our framework, we use structure from motion (SfM) to first generate 3D source and destination models, which are then registered to form the GDT through non-linear least squares and 2D point feature correspondences detected on the SfM images. This method contrasts with traditional techniques that register point clouds using 3D point descriptors. Because of the robustness of image feature descriptors, we found that using 2D instead of 3D point features facilitates the automation of the GDT generation. To benchmark our algorithm, we compared the results through an Euclidean–distance-based proposed metric with a known 3D textured model from which images were synthetically generated. We show the robustness and feasibility of our method for full size elements, wherein GDTs were generated for dry-stone and stone-mortar systems.

It presents an opportunity for the integration of the physical world to the digital world. DT technology has the potential to transform the construction industry and provide responses to some of its challenges. As a result, the concept of DT has attracted much attention and is developing at a rapid pace. The overarching aim of this study was to analyse the current state of DT applications in the construction industry. This study comprehensively reviews and analyses DT concept, technologies, and application in the construction industry using a systematic review methodology while incorporating the science mapping method. After a complete search of several databases and careful selection in line with the proposed criteria, 22 academic publications about DT application in the construction industry were identified and classified accordingly.

Among different parts of human body, building the model of the hand can be a challenging task due to the posture deviations among collected scans. In this article, we proposed a posture invariant statistical shape model (SSM) of the human hand based on 59 3D scans of human hands. First, the 3D scans were spatially aligned using a Möbius sphere-based algorithm. An articulated skeleton, which contains 20 bone segments and 16 joints, was embedded for each 3D scan. Then, all scans were aligned to the same posture using the skeleton and the linear blend skinning (LBS) algorithm. Three methods, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA), kernel-PCA (KPCA) with different kernel functions, and independent component analysis (ICA), were evaluated in the construction of the SSMs regarding the compactness, the generalization ability, and the specificity. The PCA-based SSM was selected, where 20 principal components were used as parameters for the model. Results of the leave-one-out validation indicate that the proposed model was able to fit a given 3D scan of the human hand at an accuracy of 1.21 ± 0.14 mm.

Several hazards exist when workers are within the robots' working envelope, including high mental stress induced by the robot as well as the risk of physical collision. To mitigate these risks, this study proposes a cyber-physical system (CPS) for safe, worker-centered human-robot collaboration (HRC). The physical components of the CPS include a wearable biosensor for assessing workers' mental conditions and a video camera for evaluating the risk of collision accidents. The cyber component incorporates a machine learning layer that employs a kernelized logistic regression to translate worker bio-signals into distinct physiological states. Simultaneously, the system monitors the relative distance between workers and robots by applying computer vision techniques (i.e., video frame differencing, dilation, and contour detection). To test the feasibility of the proposed CPS, six subjects were asked to perform a series of bricklaying tasks jointly with a vehicle robot with different risks of collision (various distances from the robot) and at different levels of cognitive load (various tasks' complexity).

Compared to the conventional safety training methods, Virtual Reality (VR) games offer a more immersive and interactive learning experience for the participants. However, training scenarios in most of the existing VR games lack complex tasks and the realistic environment required for actual construction. This work proposes a conceptual framework for dynamically updating VR training games through information streaming from the digital twins. The training scenarios in VR games are automatically created from the project intent information, project status knowledge, safety regulations, and historical knowledge provided by the digital twins.

However, because of traditional construction modes, most previous research has focused on forecasting ex-post analysis of carbon emissions, and few efforts have concentrated on real-time analysis, the lack of which leads to deficiencies in carbon emission control. The industrial transformation of construction has created opportunities for improvement, and similarly the developments in information technology, notably cyber-physical systems (CPS), have shown the potential to contribute to solving this problem. In several other industries, the application of CPS has made significant progress. To strengthen the monitoring and analysis of carbon emissions in prefabricated construction and thus prevent an excessive impact on the environment, this study proposes a real-time carbon emission monitoring (CEM) system for the whole industrial chain of prefabricated construction. To achieve this aim, previous studies on carbon monitoring in the construction industry are reviewed to investigate the applicability of CPS to CEM systems.

Most existing work on real-time data retrieval assume that the real-time data under study are always available for retrieval, and the developed scheduling algorithms mainly focus on making real-time decisions while meeting the temporal validity constraints. This assumption, however does not hold in many real-time applications with intermittent data availability. In this paper, we study the Availability-constrained Fresh Data Retrieval (AFDR) problem, which aims to retrieve all required real-time data for a given set of decision tasks on time while taking both the temporal validity and data availability constraints into consideration. We formulate the AFDR problem as an ILP problem and study its complexity under different settings. Given the general case of the AFDR problem is proved to be NP-hard, we focus on the cases that data items have unit-size retrieval time. For the single decision task scenario, we propose a polynomial-time optimal data retrieval algorithm, which consists of a task finish time selection phase and an optimal retrieval schedule construction phase, to solve the AFDR problem. For the multiple decision task scenario, we propose an efficient heuristic algorithm by transforming the temporal validity constraint of a real-time data item to the availability constraint. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms has been validated through extensive experiments. Our results show that the heuristic algorithm outputs around 1:5x feasible cases compared to that of the state-of-the-art scheme. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",cyber-physical systems; data availability; Real-time data retrieval; temporal validity,Decision making; Embedded systems; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Interactive computer systems; Job analysis; Polynomial approximation; Real time systems; Search engines; Complexity theory; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Data availability; Data retrieval; Heuristics algorithm; Real - Time system; Real-time data; Real-time data retrieval; Schedule; Task analysis; Temporal validity; Cyber Physical System,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052686967,"real-time data retrieval in cyber-physical systems with temporal validity and data availability constraints maintaining the temporal validity of real-time data in cyber-physical systems is of critical importance to ensure the correct decision making and appropriate system operation. most existing work on real-time data retrieval assume that the real-time data under study are always available for retrieval, and the developed scheduling algorithms mainly focus on making real-time decisions while meeting the temporal validity constraints. this assumption, however does not hold in many real-time applications with intermittent data availability. in this paper, we study the availability-constrained fresh data retrieval (afdr) problem, which aims to retrieve all required real-time data for a given set of decision tasks on time while taking both the temporal validity and data availability constraints into consideration. we formulate the afdr problem as an ilp problem and study its complexity under different settings. given the general case of the afdr problem is proved to be np-hard, we focus on the cases that data items have unit-size retrieval time. for the single decision task scenario, we propose a polynomial-time optimal data retrieval algorithm, which consists of a task finish time selection phase and an optimal retrieval schedule construction phase, to solve the afdr problem. for the multiple decision task scenario, we propose an efficient heuristic algorithm by transforming the temporal validity constraint of a real-time data item to the availability constraint. the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms has been validated through extensive experiments. our results show that the heuristic algorithm outputs around 1:5x feasible cases compared to that of the state-of-the-art scheme. © 2022 elsevier b.v., all rights reserved. cyber-physical systems; data availability; real-time data retrieval; temporal validity",True

Mobile cranes, as a central component of many construction operations, contribute to a large number of construction fatalities. While many of these fatalities are caused by inadequate planning, few of the mobile crane safety issues have been well addressed. Developments in information technologies, notably cyber-physical systems (CPS), are changing the way in which mobile crane planning can be done. With the capacity for bi-directional coordination between physical world components and their virtual representations, CPS offers advantages in monitoring mobile cranes in such a way as to facilitate effective planning, proactively monitor crane operations, provide rich multi-modal feedback to crane operators, and ultimately, to avoid mobile crane failures.
