The CPs give freedom to the decision-makers in evaluating feasible alternatives in measuring performance metrics. Previous fuzzy MCDM methods often meet strict limitations in handling real-world uncertainty and dynamic MCDM. To overcome these limitations, this study extends the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment of Evaluations (PROMETHEE-II) method to linear Diophantine fuzzy sets (LDFSs) for more flexible and robust MCDM approach. The proposed MCDM approach primarily evaluates performance metrics criterion, utilizing LDFSs which are robust extension of fuzzy sets (FSs), intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) as well as interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs). It helps decision makers to address uncertain information with membership degree (MD), non-membership degree (NMD), and CPs. For this objective, new LDFS based distance measures (DMs) and similarity measures (SMs) are developed for the construction of LDFS PROMETHEE-II technique. The proposed MCDM approach provides a structured and comprehensive framework for optimizing investment performance metrics. Its robustness is validated through sensitivity and comparative analyses. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Control parameters; Distance measures; Linear Diophantine fuzzy set; Optimizing performance metrics; Similarity measures","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Distance measurement; Fuzzy logic; Investments; Learning systems; Optimization; Sensitivity analysis; Control parameters; Distance measure; Linear diophantine fuzzy set; Multi criteria decision-making; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; Optimizing performance; Optimizing performance metric; Performance metrices; Similarity measure; Fuzzy sets","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105017566899"

Digital Twin (DT) technology offers promising capabilities for real-time safety monitoring through virtual replicas of physical systems. However, existing DT frameworks rarely integrate comprehensive safety monitoring via a centralized model consolidation mechanism, such as Federated Learning (FL), which is explicitly tailored for multi-worker scenarios. Addressing this challenge, this paper proposes a FL-based Safety Monitoring Digital Twin (SMDT) framework designed to enhance multi-worker safety in resource-constrained settings. This enables real-time safety monitoring and control by representing on-site workers as virtual objects within a synchronized DT environment. A dynamic node selection mechanism based on client performance is employed to optimize global model convergence in FL. To validate the proposed approach, an edge computing-based experimental testbed using actual Raspberry Pi devices was implemented, using real-world construction safety data including worker status, weather conditions, and building structural parameters. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in significantly improving safety predictions and real-time monitoring efficiency.

BIM models provide crucial data, including geometric details, material properties, and construction process information, which are used to create a digital twin of the bridge. Leveraging PINN’s robust fitting ability, physical laws such as stress, strain, and equilibrium equations are incorporated into the neural network to predict the bridge’s performance under various operational conditions. The integration of physical constraints during PINN training enhances both the accuracy and reliability of the predictions. Subsequently, optimization algorithms refine the bridge design based on these predictions, ensuring improvements in performance while meeting key criteria such as safety, cost-effectiveness, and environmental impact.

However, existing AI-FEA studies predominantly focus on single-material structures or simplified loading conditions, lacking a systematic framework for evaluating macro-scale responses of composite structures. To address this gap, this study proposes a failure analysis framework based on an enhanced U-shaped Transformer network, which combines the global dependency modeling capacity of attention mechanisms with a U-shaped encoder–decoder design well-suited for extracting strain-field features. The framework is applied to a novel ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC)-headed bar joint within accelerated bridge construction (ABC) systems. The enhanced Transformer-based model predicts internal rebar stresses and pull-out displacements by extracting critical features from strain field distributions. To evaluate real-world generalizability, artificial downsampling strategies were applied to simulate resolution limitations and systematic errors inherent in experimental strain measurements. Results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high prediction accuracy for rebar stresses (MAE &lt; 2.7 MPa) and pull-out displacements (MAE &lt; 0.05 mm). Furthermore, discrete stress–displacement states were fitted into a logarithmic model with low weighted orthogonal distance squared sum (W-ODSS), establishing an empirically derived failure model guided by physical observations. This criterion achieved 97.2 % accuracy in failure assessment under diverse adverse conditions. Additional FEA simulations extending beyond the original dataset parameter ranges confirmed the model’s robust predictive performance. While the present study focuses on slab-to-slab connection joints, the proposed methodology shows potential for future extension to other critical engineering scenarios, such as beam–column connections and composite slab joints. More broadly, with the integration of digital image correlation (DIC) or embedded sensing systems, this framework could contribute to advancing digital twin approaches for infrastructure lifecycle management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep learning; Failure analysis; Precast bridge slab joint; Strain field; Transformer model; Ultra-high performance concrete","Bridge decks; Concrete slabs; Data mining; Failure (mechanical); Failure analysis; Joints (structural components); Life cycle; Rebar; Strain measurement; Structural analysis; Systematic errors; Ultra-high performance concrete; Bridge slabs; Deep learning; Finite element analyse; High-performance concrete; Mechanical response; Precast bridge slab joint; Precast bridges; Strain fields; Transformer modeling; Ultra high performance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105017753675"

However, existing research primarily focuses on specific production applications, lacking consideration of the continuity across the overall production operation cycle. Such decentralized research leads to model fragmentation, data silos, and logical inconsistencies among multiple application scenarios such as pre-production planning, in-production execution, and post-production analysis, making effective integration and collaboration difficult. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Seven-Element virtual reconstruction theory that enables consistent modeling of production elements, organizational forms, and execution logic. Based on this theory, a DT shop construction and operation framework centered on unified production logic is developed to support seamless integration and collaboration of various production applications. Additionally, operation methods for three core production applications of DT shop execution, simulation, and monitoring are systematically developed, establishing an overall technical system throughout the entire production cycle driven by a unified model. Corresponding DT industrial software systems are developed to support engineering implementation of the proposed methods. Validation through an actual shop floor demonstrates that the proposed method effectively achieves model unification and data fusion across multiple application scenarios, enhances both effectiveness and consistency of DT shop construction and operation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin; Discrete manufacturing shop; Industrial software; Multiple production applications; Unified production logic","Digital twin; Production control; Application scenario; Discrete manufacturing; Discrete manufacturing shop; Industrial software; Integration and collaboration; Multiple applications; Multiple production application; Shopfloors; Unified production logic; Virtual reconstruction; Application programs","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105017594461"

Inversion in industrial assembly optimizes assembly and design by comparing real and theoretical results and doing inversion analysis to reduce assembly deviation.

A building digital twin is a virtual replica that captures a building's static and dynamic behavior through data, information, and models. Digital twin models can be developed using data-driven or physics-based approaches, each with distinct advantages and limitations. Data-driven models can learn complex behaviors from data and scale well, but they require large datasets and often lack interpretability. In contrast, physics-based models offer interpretability and generalizability through fundamental principles but can be computationally demanding. Consequently, building digital twins can benefit greatly from integrating both approaches through hybrid modeling. However, the literature lacks a comprehensive analysis of integration strategies within building digital twins. This study addresses that gap by reviewing advances in data-driven and physics-based modeling and analyzing various integration levels. The results show that most studies rely on siloed models, using either approach independently without leveraging their complementary strengths. Some adopted sequential integration, where one model informs the other but lacks real-time or iterative feedback. A few achieved coupled integration, involving active data exchange and collaboration between models. Only three studies explored fusion integration, where both approaches are fully unified into a single model. Based on this review, a method is proposed for selecting the appropriate level of integration, considering factors such as data availability, interpretability, generalizability, and domain knowledge. Finally, key research gaps and future directions are identified to guide further work. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Building digital twin; Data-driven modeling; Hybrid modeling; Model integration; Physics-based modeling","Building Information Model; Buildings; Data integration; Digital twin; Electronic data interchange; Integration; Iterative methods; Large datasets; Metadata; Virtual reality; Building digital twin; Data driven; Data-driven model; Hybrid model; In-buildings; Interpretability; Modeling approach; Models integration; Physics-based models; Systematic Review; Construction industry","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105017734857"

The geometric analysis of a “digital twin” of the built environment can contribute to provide quantitative evidence to support urban policies like planning of interventions and incentives for the transition to renewable energy. In this work, we present a geometry-based approach to efficiently and accurately estimate the photovoltaic (PV) energy produced by urban roofs. The method combines a primitive fitting technique for detecting and characterizing building roof components from aerial LiDAR data with an optimization strategy to determine the maximum number and optimal placement of PV modules on each roof surface. The energy production of the PV system on each building over a specified time period (e.g., one year) is estimated based on the solar radiation received by each PV module and the shadow projected by neighboring buildings or trees and efficiency requirements. The strength of the proposed approach is its ability to combine computational techniques, domain expertise, and heterogeneous data into a logical and automated workflow, whose effectiveness is evaluated and tested on a large-scale, real-world urban areas with complex morphology in Italy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational geometry; Photovoltaics; Primitive fitting; Primitive recognition; Semantic segmentation; Urban digital twins","Antennas; Digital twin; Energy efficiency; Optical radar; Photogrammetry; Photovoltaics; Roofs; Semantics; Urban planning; Land managements; Photovoltaic energy; Photovoltaic modules; Point-clouds; Primitive fitting; Primitives recognition; Semantic segmentation; Urban digital twin; Urban management; Computational geometry","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015834170"

Many material processes require optimisation of complex spatiotemporal dynamics which are difficult to monitor with limited sensor measurements at accessible locations in the process. The DMD-KF approach facilitates the extraction of a spatiotemporal dynamic model with minimal computation time from numerical simulations, integrated with real-time sensor measurements of the accessible states to correct model errors. The method is demonstrated for real-time spatiotemporal monitoring of component cooling in the injection moulding process. Injection Moulding is a high-volume manufacturing process, which faces challenges in dimensional precision due to shrinkage and warpage defects which manifest post-production due to the gradual relaxation of internal residual stresses. To prevent internal stresses, the component should be sufficiently free of significant temperature differentials prior to ejection from the mould. However, the inaccessible nature of the mould tool limits sensor access for monitoring of the cooling phase. Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) allows a best fit, linear state–space model of the temperature dynamics of 3D spatial nodes of the component to be extracted from a computationally-intensive finite element model of the process. Using only two thermocouple measurements, integrated with the DMD model via a Kalman Filter (KF), allows for construction of the 3D temperature map of the component inside the mould in real time. Simulation of different processing scenarios highlights that even with a DMD model developed under significantly different process conditions than used in implementation, the KF corrections still effectively estimate the temperature of critical states with with a root mean square error of 1.4 °C. The DMD-KF approach shows high potential for real-time spatio-temporal monitoring and quality prediction across diverse manufacturing processes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Twin; Dynamic mode decomposition; Injection moulding; Kalman Filter","Cooling; Digital twin; Dynamic mode decomposition; Dynamics; Mean square error; Molds; Process monitoring; Thermocouples; Decomposition model; Dynamic mode decompositions; Filter approach; Injection molding process; Manufacturing process; ON dynamics; Real- time; Sensor measurements; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Spatiotemporal process; Injection molding; Kalman filters","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013488745"

Employing life cycle assessment and building stock modelling through an archetype-based approach, it estimates the greenhouse gas mitigation potential of renovating the entire Estonian residential building stock by 2050, as outlined in the national long-term renovation strategy. The analysis incorporates alternative future scenarios to depict potential emissions trajectories contingent upon the effectiveness of policy implementation. The study utilises comprehensive data from the Estonian Building Registry—one of the earliest examples of a national digital twin—encompassing the whole residential building stock. The findings indicate that the complete implementation of decarbonisation strategies could reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions from the existing residential stock by up to 95 % compared to 2020. The embodied emissions from the renovation measures are minor compared to the energy savings gained. In the Estonian context, the overall success of building decarbonisation is closely tied to the carbon intensity of grid electricity. If the current fuel mix in electricity and district heating production persists, comprehensive renovation may paradoxically result in higher emissions than the baseline. While seemingly counterintuitive, this outcome is primarily attributable to the low carbon intensity of wood-based heating, which is prevalent in detached houses. Electrification of heating and installing mechanical ventilation systems increase the electricity demand.

How to construct the digital coordinated transmission mode of construction information and realize intelligent decision-making and control is still a bottleneck problem restricting the development and practice of intelligent construction. In this study, the characterization and operation method of cable structure intelligent construction unit (ICU) based on digital twin (DT) is proposed. According to the construction forming characteristics of cable structure, the ICU assembly is defined from the perspective of structural components, construction process and control index. The basic unit is divided, and the mechanism of intelligent construction unit is clarified. Based on the efficient construction of human-computer interaction, a DT six-dimensional reference model is established to realize the sensing and integration, calculation and analysis, control and execution of construction information. On this basis, the operation method of ICU of cable structure driven by DT is given from three aspects: optimal operation control, process correlation coupling and process evolution.

However, traditional performance model adaptation methods based on physical models face challenges in-flight environments due to their high computational resource demands and the potential instability of numerical methods that rely heavily on initial conditions. This study addresses these limitations through a novel approach. This study attempted to use a machine learning (ML) model of a turbofan engine using neural networks to adapt to performance variations based on measurement data from flight conditions. The construction of the ML model is divided into three parts. In the first part, engine data were generated using a physics-based engine model that accounts for operating conditions and component adaptation factors (AFs). Additionally, two ML models were developed: one for calculating AFs based on operating conditions and sensor data, and another for predicting the engine performance using the operating conditions and component AFs. In the second part, the component AFs were calculated using measured parameters, and an additional ML model was developed to calculate the component AFs from the operating conditions. In the third part, the final engine model was constructed by integrating the ML models. The ML engine model, in conjunction with operating conditions, can predict the engine performance and sensor values. The self-adaptation of the performance model is achievable through the processes of the first and second parts. During the training phase, the model's maximum prediction errors for critical parameters such as the compressor rotor speed and fan turbine inlet temperature were 0.61 % and 0.94 %, respectively.

Robots, serving as indispensable execution units in this domain, have traditionally been implemented in serial or rigid parallel configurations. However, these robots typically encounter challenges such as limited load capacity, insufficient rigidity, and complex singularities. Although DT technology has been increasingly applied to robot modeling and simulation, current research falls short in addressing coordinating dynamic assembly processes and ensuring digital-physical synchronization. This gap fails to fully meet the demands of complex assembly tasks. To address these challenges, this study investigates cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs) with a large workspace, high load capacity, and strong dynamic performance. A DT-based smart assembly application framework for CDPRs is proposed, and four key technologies are explored in depth: (1) cable-driven parallel robots assembly process digital twin (CAPDT) model construction; (2) task-level assembly planning; (3) adaptive assembly instruction generation; and (4) CAPDT model consistency retention. These technologies collectively support assembly task planning, simulation verification, performance control, and process management. Finally, a simplified satellite assembly task is presented as a case study, and a DT-based CDPR assembly prototype system for is developed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed application framework and technologies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assembly task planning; Cable-driven parallel robots; Digital twin; Process management; Smart assembly","Big data; Cables; Digital twin; Distributed computer systems; Process control; Robotic assembly; Smart manufacturing; Application frameworks; Assembly process; Assembly task planning; Assembly tasks; Cable-driven; Cable-driven parallel robot; Parallel robots; Process management; Smart assembly; Task planning; Industrial research","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009950154"

Archetypal building modelling (ABM), as a method that abstracts diverse buildings into representative archetypes, still faces challenges in standardising building types, modelling dynamic features, and ensuring cross-regional applicability. These limitations hinder UBEM's ability to balance accuracy and scalability in complex and heterogeneous urban building contexts. Based on the PRISMA methodology, this study systematically reviews relevant literature, outlining the definition and development trajectory of ABM, and analysing the impact of integrating static and dynamic datasets on model accuracy. Furthermore, the study explores the extraction of classification factors, clustering methods, and model validation strategies, while evaluating the influence of digital technologies on ABM. The findings indicate that although ABM effectively reduces modelling complexity and improves computational efficiency, it still encounters challenges such as limited classification criteria, insufficient data, and inadequate regional validation. Future efforts should focus on: firstly, enhancing the standardisation of building archetypes by establishing unified, multi-scale classification criteria; secondly, improving data collection and integration methods to support full lifecycle data for both new and existing buildings; thirdly, developing cross-scale validation frameworks to ensure accurate translation between macro-level predictions and micro-level assessments; and fourthly, leveraging digital twin technology and deep learning to achieve dynamic optimisation and real-time energy efficiency management of archetype models. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Archetypal building modelling; Building performance simulation; Built environment; Energy efficiency; Systematic review; Urban building energy models","Buildings; Classification (of information); Cluster analysis; Computational efficiency; Data integration; Deep learning; Energy utilization; Global optimization; Information management; Life cycle; Archetypal building modeling; Building energy model; Building model; Building performance simulations; Built environment; Classification criterion; Energy; Systematic Review; Urban building energy model; Urban buildings; Energy efficiency","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009302393"

The lack of data results in disconnection between data from different spaces, posing a challenge to forming a closed loop of data and hindering the development of digital twin (DT) driven fault diagnosis (FD). To address these issues, a new DT paradigm Digital-Triplet is proposed. This paradigm comprises three entities: a physical entity, a semi-physical entity, and a virtual entity. A semi-physical entity is created by implementing the ""six-D"" process on the physical entity. A new six dimensional structure is formed through the addition of the semi-physical entity. The new structure streamlines the construction of fault datasets, enhances sensor data acquisition, and tightly links different data spaces, thereby promoting the application of DT in equipment FD. Subsequently, the elevator is selected as a case study to illustrate the Digital-Triplet framework in detail.

To address the limited modeling performance of traditional theoretical methods, which often lead to unsatisfactory trajectory planning decisions, this paper proposes a digital twin-driven excavation trajectory planning method for UME in autonomous operation scenarios, utilizing multidisciplinary co-simulation. Firstly, the complete excavating process is decomposed and the subsystems' dynamic responses consisting of the digging load, excavation dynamics and structural response of the working devices are simulated, respectively. Considering the transference and coupling of the variables between different subsystems, a digital twin dynamical model of the UME is established by an integrated data-physics fusion strategy with multidisciplinary co-simulation. Furthermore, by integrating multiple objectives and multiple constraints with the digital twin model, a nonlinear optimization formulation of excavation trajectory is constructed to perform adaptive computation for UME. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of saving time and reducing energy consumption compared to other conventional approaches.

The results of this paper demonstrate the adaptability of RDG to construction process variations, which allows BIM models to reflect real-time project updates accurately. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Building information modeling (BIM); Construction simulation; Digital twin; Random discrete generation (RDG)","Architectural design; Building components; Building Information Model; Construction; Decision making; Information theory; Project management; Building information modeling; Building Information Modelling; Construction process; Construction simulation; Construction sites; Dynamic generation; Generation method; Random discrete generation; Real- time; Structural component; Digital twin","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010318611"

The material intensity and composition are estimated based on on-site investigations, laser scanning to capture detailed building geometry, and a BIM model to represent building components digitally. Additionally, the spatial distribution of building stock is modeled based on a GIS model. The proposed approach is demonstrated and verified in a case study of 23 typical residential buildings in an Egyptian district.

One such solution to decarbonization could be energy sharing between buildings. This paper presents the potential for energy saving and subsequent reduction in carbon emission with a low temperature district network in an energy community based in Malmö, Sweden. In this study, environmental impact of energy consumption has been performed, together with a Modelica based simulation which incorporates the detailed dynamic modelling of the digital twin of energy system stationed at this community. The modelled network is of a novel design that features geothermal boreholes as the primary energy source for the community's thermal demands and allows sharing of excess energy between the buildings connected to the network. The study shows that sharing energy between the buildings improves the overall seasonal performance of the substation from 5.2 to 6.2 and reduces the net purchase of energy by approximately 14.1 % in comparison to the standalone systems. Furthermore, benefits were identified in the form of load sharing between borefields accounting to approximately 50 MWh of thermal energy exchange between the substation's borefield leading to a longer operational lifespan of borefields. The result also showed that emissions from the studied network are only 7 % of the emissions associated with the existing district heating network available in the region, thereby emphasizing the substantial environmental benefits and great potential to reduce emissions related to urban heating and cooling in general. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Architectural design; % reductions; Building industry; Building stocks; Design solutions; District networks; Energy; Energy use; European union; Heating and cooling; Lows-temperatures; Construction industry","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007808588"

Despite their potential, systematic analysis of frameworks and enabling technologies remains lacking. This review systematically investigates over 150 studies to: (1) analyze the general framework and its extensions for building digital twins, and (2) evaluate enabling technologies and tools based on the modeling procedure. We propose a general structure for building digital twins and analyze frameworks centered on four data types derived from different sources. Our analysis indicates that different types of frameworks exhibit distinct characteristics and inherent limitations, yet a standardized framework for integrating heterogeneous data is still lacking. Through systematic analysis of enabling technologies across four key aspects of the modeling procedure, we investigate building digital twin cases regarding their modeling procedures, technologies employed, and common issues. We identify four key challenges: (1) limited prediction data integration and data analysis, restricting frameworks to monitoring rather than decision-supporting; (2) multi-source data heterogeneity and poor tool interoperability; (3) complex and non-standardized data integration procedures; and (4) low automation in model development. Future research should focus on: (1) standardizing data formats and interoperability tools, (2) developing unified platforms for multi-source data integration, and (3) integrating predictive analytics to enhance decision-making.

Existing deep learning approaches either impose prohibitive computational demands for on-site deployment or disrupt the topological continuity of subpixel lineaments that govern rock mass behavior. This study presents BATNet-Lite, a lightweight encoder–decoder architecture optimized for joint segmentation on resource-constrained devices. The encoder introduces a Boundary-Aware Token-Mixing (BATM) block that separates feature maps into patch tokens and directionally pooled stripe tokens, and a bidirectional attention mechanism subsequently transfers global context to local descriptors while refining stripe features, thereby capturing long-range connectivity with negligible overhead. A complementary Multi-Scale Line Enhancement (MLE) module combines depth-wise dilated and deformable convolutions to yield scale-invariant responses to joints of varying apertures. In the decoder, a Skeletal-Contrastive Decoder (SCD) employs dual heads to predict segmentation and skeleton maps simultaneously, while an InfoNCE-based contrastive loss enforces their topological consistency without requiring explicit skeleton labels. Training leverages a composite focal Tversky and edge IoU loss under a curriculum-thinning schedule, improving edge adherence and continuity. Ablation experiments confirm that BATM, MLE, and SCD each contribute substantial gains in boundary accuracy and connectivity preservation. By delivering topology-preserving joint maps with small parameters, BATNet-Lite facilitates rapid geological data acquisition for tunnel face mapping, slope inspection, and subsurface digital twin development, thereby supporting safer and more efficient building and underground engineering practice. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","computer vision; line segmentation; rock fracture; rock joint; semantic segmentation","Data acquisition; Decoding; Deep learning; Image coding; Image segmentation; Mapping; Mixer circuits; Mixing; Musculoskeletal system; Rock mechanics; Rocks; Semantics; Signal encoding; Topology; Design assessments; Drill core; Joint segmentation; Line enhancement; Line segmentation; Multi-scales; Rock fractures; Rock joint; Safety assessments; Semantic segmentation; Computer vision","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015561637"

Employing a hybrid re-view methodology—combining scientometric mapping and qualitative content analysis—52 relevant studies were analyzed to identify technological trends, implementation barriers, and emerging research themes. The findings reveal that AI-driven DTs enable dynamic scheduling, predictive maintenance, real-time quality control, and sustainable lifecycle management across all IOC phases. Seven thematic application clusters are identified, including logistics optimization, safety management, and data interoperability, supported by a layered architectural framework and key enabling technologies. This study contributes to the literature by providing an early synthesis that integrates technical, organizational, and strategic dimensions of AI-driven DT implementation in IOC context.

The building was modeled using EnergyPlus 23.1.0 after construction, although no validation was performed due to the absence of metered consumption data. Previous approaches relying on simplified methods such as the Radiant Time Series (RTS), which neglect dynamic building behavior, have often led to overestimated cooling and heating loads. This has emerged as a major obstacle in designing energy-efficient buildings within the context of compact and smart cities pursuing carbon neutrality. Consequently, the trend in building performance analysis is shifting toward dynamic simulations and digital twin-based design methodologies. Furthermore, electrification of buildings without adequate thermal load assessment may also contribute to overdesign, irrespective of urban environmental characteristics. From an urban planning standpoint, there is a growing need for performance criteria that reflect occupant behavior and actual usage patterns. However, dynamics-based building studies remain scarce in the Republic of Korea. In this context, the present study demonstrates that passive design strategies, implemented through systematic changes in envelope materials, HVAC operational standards, and compliance with ASHRAE 90.1 criteria, can significantly enhance thermal comfort and indoor air quality. The simulation results show that energy consumption can be reduced by over 36.21% without compromising occupant health or comfort. These findings underscore the importance of thermal load understanding prior to electrification and highlight the potential of LEED-aligned passive strategies for achieving high-performance, low-energy buildings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS); heat ventilation air conditioning (HVAC); leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED); passive design; radiant time series (RTS)","Architectural design; Energy utilization; Environmental design; Green buildings; HVAC; Indoor air pollution; Intelligent buildings; Thermal load; Urban growth; Dedicated outdoor air system; Dedicated outdoor air systems; Heat ventilation air conditioning; Leadership in energy and environmental design; Leadership in energy and environmental designs; Passive design; Radiant time series; Thermal; Times series; Ventilation airs; Office buildings","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015356465"

Yet, within Smart Heritage discourse, the distinction between basic digital representations and truly responsive, sensor-informed systems remains underdeveloped. This study addresses this gap by proposing a machine learning–enhanced digital twin simulation framework that enables both real-time and anticipatory heritage interventions. Using Chinatown Melbourne as an urban heritage case study, five open-access urban datasets, pedestrian counting, on-street parking, microclimate conditions, dwelling functionality, and Microlab sensor data (CO<inf>2</inf>, sound level, and accelerometer), were evaluated, with three integrated into a pilot simulation model. A key contribution is the inclusion of a conceptual ‘Heritage Layer’ that overlays cultural significance and symbolic meaning across all stages of system logic and design response. The model also incorporates a dedicated machine learning layer, trained on full-year 2024 sensor data, to forecast environmental and behavioural triggers such as crowd build-up. This predictive capability enables the system to shift from reactive monitoring to proactive design interventions aligned with cultural rhythms. A December 2024 simulation validated the frequency and relevance of trigger-based activations. Rather than relying on platform-specific code, the framework is designed for adaptability across construction informatics environments and heritage precincts globally. Findings demonstrate how Smart Heritage systems can bridge environmental sensing, cultural identity, and post-construction evaluation, offering a scalable methodology for digitally responsive, culturally attuned urban heritage management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chinatown Melbourne; Digital Twin Framework; Environmental Monitoring; Heritage Site Construction Informatics; Heritage-Aware Design; Machine Learning for Heritage Sites; Smart Heritage; Urban Sensor","Environmental management; Historic preservation; Informatics; Learning systems; Machine learning; Open access; Urban growth; Chinatown melbourne; Digital twin framework; Environmental Monitoring; Heritage site construction informatic; Heritage sites; Heritage-aware design; Machine learning for heritage site; Machine-learning; Melbourne; Site construction; Smart heritage; Urban sensor; Sustainable development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015042032"

Traditional Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) methods—primarily reliant on manual inspections or threshold-based sensor alerts—struggle to deliver the responsiveness, adaptability, and scalability demanded by modern urban environments in the fields of civil and transportation engineering. This paper introduces a hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that integrates machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and rule-based reasoning within an edge–cloud architecture for real-time infrastructure monitoring. The system architecture consists of edge-level ML models, including Support Vector Machines and Random Forests, for fast anomaly detection; cloud-level CNN-LSTM networks for temporal pattern recognition; and a rule-based expert system to ensure interpretability and domain consistency across civil and transportation engineering use cases. Data from distributed IoT sensors is pre-processed, normalized, and fused using wavelet transformation, PCA, and statistical extraction methods. Metaheuristic optimization algorithms—Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO)—are employed to fine-tune hyperparameters and select relevant features. Experimental results demonstrate high classification accuracy (up to 96.2%) at the edge, low prediction error (RMSE = 0.085) in cloud-based forecasting, and generalizability under optimization. The proposed hybrid AI system outperforms conventional SHM systems in speed, accuracy, and domain robustness, and is validated for real-world applications in civil and transportation engineering infrastructure. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin integration in civil and transportation infrastructure; Edge–cloud computing architecture; Hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) systems; Metaheuristic optimization algorithms; Structural health monitoring (SHM)","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009934829"

Although research has advanced the technical aspects of digital twins, there is a notable gap in examining human performance factors, particularly situation awareness – a cognitive process crucial for recognizing, comprehending, and anticipating changes in the work environment. With greater reliance on automation, neglecting this critical capability can lead to severe oversights, particularly during disruptions. To address this gap, we conducted a qualitative study grounded in a theoretical framework to explore the situation awareness requirements under different disruption scenarios in two contrasting construction contexts: offsite production and onsite assembly. First, drawing on 16 semi-structured interviews and non-participant field observations, we employ goal-directed task analysis to reveal the distinct information needs in each context. Second, through a comprehensive content analysis of the interview narratives, we identify the dynamics of gaining and maintaining situation awareness and provide digital twin design recommendations. Findings indicate that managers must shift from a macro-level overview to a micro-level detail in offsite production, requiring digital twin displays with adaptable granularity. In contrast, onsite assembly demands an intensely iterative approach to situational awareness, which calls for comprehensive real-time digital twin displays that support quick back-and-forth assessments. This study contributes by formalizing experts’ background knowledge, which can serve as a valuable basis for creating context-sensitive digital twin systems that better support human decision-making in offsite construction contexts and beyond. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Construction Management; Digital Twin; Goal-Directed Task Analysis; Human-Data Interaction; Offsite Construction; Situation Awareness","Construction industry; Decision making; Digital twin; Information management; Iterative methods; Job analysis; Construction management; Construction manager; Data interactions; Digital technologies; Goal-directed task analysis; Human data; Human-data interaction; Off-site construction; Off-site production; Situation awareness; Project management","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008547836"

However, the development of the assembly digital twin technology faces significant challenges due to “information silos” resulting from ineffective data exchange among multi-source heterogeneous data involved in assembly processes. This study proposes a Digital Twin-based Assembly Process Framework (DT-APF) designed to systematically organize and manage multi-stage manufacturing data. Through object instantiation, the framework establishes a Digital Twin-based Assembly Process Information Model (DT-APIM) that enables standardized transformation of heterogeneous data. By converting the instance of the DT-APIM into a graph-based structure, the framework generates a Digital Twin-based Assembly Process Knowledge Graph (DT-APKG), achieving deep integration of multi-source data. Furthermore, the integration of Autoregressive Structured Prediction (ASP) algorithm constructs a knowledge reasoning engine, establishing a comprehensive data organization and knowledge reasoning system that spans the entire assembly lifecycle. Experimental validation was conducted using an aero-engine casing assembly case. Results demonstrate that the ASP-based reasoning mechanism validates the effectiveness in identifying assembly performance correlations, while the DT-APF framework improves data integration efficiency by 31.6% compared with traditional knowledge graph construction approaches.

With increasing traffic volume and extreme weather conditions, these bridges face threats to their functional and structural safety during their service life, necessitating timely health monitoring and condition assessment. In recent years, digital twin (DT) has achieved significant progress in bridge monitoring and assessment, effectively addressing the shortcomings of traditional methods. However, current bridge DTs, especially those for cable-supported bridges, still face a series of issues, such as ambiguous concepts and lack of unified standards. To enrich the discussion on this topic, this paper explores the current research trends and frameworks of bridge DT through bibliometric analysis and a comprehensive review of the latest advancements, providing a systematic overview of relevant research on health monitoring and condition assessment of cable-supported bridges based on DT. Firstly, the origin, definition, and characteristics of DT are introduced. Secondly, a systematic literature review is employed to statistically analyze the current research status and discuss the construction methods of the DT system. Subsequently, a novel three-layer framework for DT is proposed, which can be applied to health monitoring and condition assessment of cable-supported bridges. Finally, the challenges and future trends of DT in this field are discussed. The challenges consist of seven aspects, which are data management, modeling, security and privacy, service applications, intelligence, integration, and standardization. Future DT development will focus on advancing digitization, integration, and intelligence, while deepening theoretical research and practical applications. The establishment of a reliable operational condition assessment framework is also an important trend. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cable-supported bridges; Condition assessment; Digital twin; Health monitoring; Literature review","Bridges; Cables; Data privacy; Digital twin; Information management; Public works; Structural health monitoring; 'current; Cable-supported bridges; Civil infrastructures; Condition assessments; Extreme weather conditions; Health condition; Health monitoring; Literature reviews; Monitoring assessment; Traffic volumes; Health risks","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008212834"

Automation can not only bring significant time and cost savings, but it can also facilitate digitalization efforts like the Road Digital Twin (DT). However, as is the case with many Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) applications, annotated data availability is low, which demands exploration of specialized techniques for resource-constrained settings that have not been focused on in engineering. This work bridges this gap by proposing a data-efficient similarity-based text classifier that aims at effectively utilizing existing domain knowledge and pre-training knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable rapid domain adaptation. It reformulates text classification as a similarity comparison task, using semantics directly as a classification criterion. Through a case study on classifying road inspection comments, the proposed classifier outperformed both traditionally fine-tuned and few-shot learning approaches. It attained an f1 score of 0.46 with just one example per class, equivalent to the value for Sentence Transformer Fine-Tuning (SetFit) with 4 examples and Llama3 with 10. Additionally, it is able to keep up with traditional fine-tuning methods when trained with more than 300,000 total examples, achieving an accuracy of more than 95% and f1 of around 0.9. These results indicate that the proposal is competitive against traditionally fine-tuned and few-shot models across all levels of data availability.

The construction of twin models constitutes the prerequisite for the practical implementation and application of CDT. However, the existing research on emergency scenario twin modeling falls short in providing a unified modeling method that comprehensively captures the multidimensional characteristics of scenario elements. This deficiency, coupled with inadequate analysis of interelement interactions and constraints posed by semantic inconsistencies and interoperability among twin models, hampers the accurate mapping of physical scenarios and their evolution dynamics. In response to the multielement, uncertainty, and dynamic nature of urban road emergency scenarios, this paper proposes a CDT modeling method for urban road emergency scenarios. First, the definitions of element-level and scenario-level twin models are elucidated in three dimensions-geometry, attribute, and behavior-in conjunction with resilience theory. Second, a modeling method based on SysML and ontology is proposed for twin models at different levels, and a SysML2Ontology transformation tool is developed to enable the systematic construction of emergency scenario cognitive digital twin (ESCDT). Furthermore, a CDT framework for urban road emergency management centered on twin models is introduced. Finally, the North-South Elevated Road in Shanghai, China, is used as the engineering application object. The feasibility of our modeling methodology is validated through a case study, which involves the construction of the ESCDT for a collision accident. The model can be further utilized for emergency scenario deduction, ultimately elevating the effectiveness of emergency management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Civil defense; Digital twin; Disasters; Highway planning; Interoperability; Life cycle; Risk management; Roads and streets; Accurate mapping; Cycle data; Emergency management; Emergency scenario; Model method; Scenario models; Semantic inconsistencies; Semantic interoperability; Unified modeling method; Urban road; Semantics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007947786"

In this context, a key challenge for DTs is integrating heterogeneous data sources to address requirements that evolve across different life cycle phases and use cases. A modular approach for deploying DTs offers a flexible and scalable solution that can adapt to these changing requirements. However, a clear definition and structure of DT modules for the built environment are still missing. This research presents a modular System Reference Architecture (SRA) for implementing Semantic DTs in the construction industry. As its central component, the SRA leverages the inherently modular Asset Administration Shell (AAS) reference model for asset DTs in Industry 4.0. Built on submodels, each addressing a specific use case or aspect, the AAS serves as a high-level framework for DTs. The SRA extends the AAS with standardized Information Containers for Linked Document Delivery (ICDD), integrated through a Linked Data approach employing a semantic layer of ontologies. The feasibility of the proposed SRA is demonstrated through a case-specific implementation for the precast concrete production. Two submodels are developed within the SRA: one for accessing dynamic sensor data via time series databases and another for integrating BIM-derived semantic data using ICDD. The architecture is evaluated through a simulated curing process, where SPARQL and REST-based queries enable real-time monitoring and feedback control. The results confirm the SRA's ability to integrate heterogeneous data sources, support semantic interoperability, and facilitate lifecycle-oriented feedback mechanisms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asset Administration Shell; Construction; Digital Twin; Information Container for Linked Document Delivery; Linked data; Reference Architecture","Architectural design; Concrete buildings; Concrete industry; Structural analysis; Architecture-based; Asset administration shell; Design construction; Design operations; Document delivery; Heterogeneous data sources; Information container for linked document delivery; Modular system; Reference architecture; Submodels; Construction industry","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007937317"

To this end, this study proposes an innovative approach, “Enhanced Digital Twin (EDT)”, to overcome the traditional DTs’ limitations. To achieve this, a scientometric review is conducted based on quantitative mixed methods using VOSviewer and RStudio to analyse the collected database from Scopus of 342 peer-reviewed journal articles from 2020 to 2024.

However, the inherent complexity of buildings, their long operational lifespans, and the specific nature of the construction industry pose significant challenges in creating digital twins for buildings. Intelligent digital twins (IDTs) address these challenges by integrating existing digital twin models with AI, enabling a comprehensive representation of the building lifecycle while incorporating expert input. This study proposes an AI agent-based IDT framework using an ontological approach, where AI agents are engineered by DT administrators with building operations and maintenance (O&M) data, information, and applications within an ontological DT environment. Data and information generated within this environment are expressed in the DT ontology, enabling AI agents to gain a holistic understanding of the target system. Applications are integrated as a tool, thereby enabling AI agents to expand their actions and gain additional information from results. To validate this framework, virtual in-situ modeling (VIM) and fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) algorithms were implemented as DT applications to demonstrate the operation of the IDT system. Four case studies were conducted to demonstrate IDT-enabled O&M services, and LangSmith was used to visualize the AI agents' reasoning process as part of the result validation. It shows that AI agents have capabilities of performing building O&M tasks with high-level reasoning. The significance of this study lies in demonstrating the feasibility of implementing IDT models in building O&M by enabling AI agents to provide comprehensive, domain-specific knowledge and perform operational tasks, thereby serving as an assistant for both users and operators.

The major challenges include a non-standardized production process, unlike mass production, and the construction of complex, large-scale structures. This paper explores the introduction of intelligent autonomous robotic systems capable of adapting to such variability, with the primary objective of reducing the reliance on non-specialized labour and reallocating personnel to high-value tasks. The field of robotics is currently undergoing a paradigm shift, driven by the maturity of artificial intelligence (AI). Traditional control and optimization algorithms are being progressively replaced by neural networks leveraging large language models (LLMs) and transformer-based architectures. These advancements unlock new possibilities in shipyard automation, enhancing flexibility and operational intelligence. The adoption of digital twins and their interconnection with digital systems that monitor production further enhances these capabilities, enabling simulation and optimization to ensure efficiency and precision throughout the shipbuilding process. Two primary areas of intervention are addressed in this paper: logistics and production. In logistics, the focus is on autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) for indoor and outdoor operations, with or without carts, as well as solutions for picking and palletization. In production, smart robotic solutions are proposed for quality inspection, progress monitoring, and specialized tasks such as welding and grinding. A specific use case examined in this study focuses on the development of humanoid robots, starting from their movement dynamics to the execution of complex tasks. The research explores how humanoids can learn and adapt to shipbuilding environments. This approach aims to enhance the versatility and efficiency of humanoid robots, enabling them to perform a wide range of operations, from assembly tasks to inspection activities, with minimal human intervention. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI; AMR; Digital Twin; Humanoid Robot; Logistic; Shipbuilding","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105016237475"

Currently, the industry has the capacity to operate at BIM Maturity stage 2 but faces challenges in achieving seamless data integration and interoperability. Progressing toward BIM Maturity Stage 3 could benefit from adopting semantic web and linked data technologies, which enable a more structured, machine-readable data environment. However, the path to this level of integration remains complex. At the heart of the semantic web lies ontologies, playing a pivotal role in structuring domain knowledge. Therefore, through a systematic literature review, this study explores the integration of ontologies and semantic web technologies in BIM or Digital Twin environments for construction management. This study provides a trend and theoretical analysis under different construction management use cases to identify how ontologies and semantic web technologies have been utilised during the construction execution phase. The study identified eight different use cases, including safety management, compliance checking, and construction planning and production control, among others. The findings emphasise that while there is great potential in using ontologies and the semantic web for data integration, significant barriers remain, such as data privacy concerns, scalability issues, and the complexity of ontology mapping. These findings underscore the importance of addressing these challenges to fully harness the capabilities of semantic web technologies within BIM environments, providing a potential roadmap toward realising BIM Maturity Stage 3 and to enhance collaboration and data exchange in the construction industry. This study provides a roadmap for future research and technological development in applying semantic web technologies to advance construction management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AEC Industry; BIM; Digital Twins; Industry Foundation Classes (IFC); Linked Data; Ontologies; Semantic Web","Architectural design; Building Information Model; Compliance control; Construction; Construction industry; Data integration; Data privacy; Digital twin; Electronic data interchange; Environmental management; Information management; Information theory; Integration; Production control; Project management; Research and development management; Semantic Web; AEC industry; Application of ontologies; Building Information Modelling; Construction management; Industry foundation class; Maturity stages; Ontology's; Roadmap; Semantic Web technology; Semantic-Web; Ontology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015045684"

However, traditional DTs face challenges in autonomous decision-making, environmental adaptability, reasoning abilities, and functionality when applied to dynamic, complex scenarios. Cognitive Digital Twin (CDT) have emerged to address these challenges, offering enhanced cognitive capabilities over conventional DT. Concurrently, advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities to augment CDT through advanced semantic understanding and contextual analysis. This paper systematically reviews CDT development, elucidating their core cognitive mechanisms and assessing the impact of LLMs on their future evolution. By analyzing existing literature, we outline the developmental context, core concepts, key characteristics, and framework construction methods of CDT. We identify significant research gaps, notably the lack of systematic articulation of CDT's cognitive mechanisms and the underexplored potential of integrating LLMs to enhance their cognitive functions. Our contributions are threefold: (1) providing the research progress of CDT, (2) exploring the application potential of LLMs in enhancing CDT's cognitive capabilities, and (3) identifying key challenges in applying LLMs within manufacturing environments. Future research should focus on developing comprehensive integration frameworks for LLMs and CDT and improving the reliability and security of CDT systems. By advancing CDT technology and integrating LLM capabilities, this study hopes to support the realization of Industry 4.0. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Cognitive Digital Twin (CDT); Industry 4.0; Large Language Models (LLMs); Smart manufacturing","Cognitive systems; Decision making; Industrial research; Semantics; Smart manufacturing; Cognitive capability; Cognitive digital twin; Cognitive mechanisms; Digital representations; High-fidelity; Intelligent Manufacturing; Language model; Large language model; Real time monitoring; Artificial intelligence","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014803313"

However, traditional slump testing is manual and cannot assess concrete in transit. This study presents a cyber-physical system (CPS) integrating IoT sensors with machine learning models to estimate concrete workability in real time during delivery. The proposed approach first correlates traditional slump test parameters with sensor measurements, allowing for automated replication of established workability evaluation. The CPS continuously captures IoT sensor data, such as drum rotation, vibration, internal pressure, and temperature, processes these data in real time, and infers workability before unloading. The developed CPS was validated in a real-world case study, achieving high workability prediction accuracy with an average error of approximately 0.9 cm and timely, automated feedback of below 200 ms.

We introduce a pioneering, four-tiered hierarchical productivity framework to respond to these challenges. This innovative approach integrates operational, tactical, strategic, and normative layers. At its core, the framework applies standardised, repeatable process steps—mapped using Value Stream Mapping (VSM)—to capture key indicators such as input efficiency, output effectiveness, and First-Time Quality (FTQ). These are then aggregated through takt time compliance, schedule reliability, and workload balance to evaluate trade synchronisation and flow stability. Higher-level metrics—flow efficiency, multi-resource utilisation, and ESG-linked performance—are integrated into an Overall Productivity Index (OPI). Building on a modular production model, the proposed framework supports real-time sensing, AI-driven monitoring, and intelligent process control, as demonstrated through an empirical case study of continuous process monitoring for Kelly drilling operations. This validation illustrates how sensor-equipped machinery and machine learning algorithms can automate data capture, map observed activities to standardised process steps, and detect productivity deviations in situ. This paper contributes to a multi-scalar measurement architecture that links micro-level execution with macro-level decision-making. It provides a foundation for real-time monitoring, performance-based coordination, and data-driven innovation. The framework is applicable across modular construction, digital twins, and platform-based delivery models, offering benefits beyond specialised foundation work to all construction trades. Grounded in over a century of productivity research, the approach demonstrates how emerging technologies can deliver measurable and scalable improvements. Framing productivity as an integrative, actionable metric enables sector-wide performance gains. The framework supports construction firms, technology providers, and policymakers in advancing robust, outcome-oriented innovation strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI in construction; construction productivity; digital twins; ESG performance metrics; flow efficiency; hierarchical productivity framework; Lean Construction; robotics and automation; takt time planning","Automation; Decision making; Digital twin; Embedded systems; Lean production; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Modular construction; Process control; Process monitoring; AI in construction; Construction productivity; ESG performance metric; Flow efficiency; Hierarchical productivity framework; Lean construction; Performance metrices; Robotic and automation; TAKT time; Takt time planning; Construction industry","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014421377"

This study aims to address the problem of object coordinate distortion caused by camera image deformation, which often reduces the fidelity of dynamic object mapping in digital construction monitoring. A novel dynamic object mapping generation method is proposed to enhance precision and synchronization of dynamic objects within a digital twin environment. The approach integrates internal and external camera parameters, including spatial position, field of view (FOV), and camera pose, into BIM using Dynamo, thereby creating a virtual camera aligned with the physical one. The YOLOv11 algorithm is employed to recognize dynamic objects in real-time camera footage, and corresponding object families are generated in the BIM model. Using perspective projection combined with a linear regression model, the system computes and updates accurate coordinate positions of the dynamic objects, which are then fed back into the camera view to achieve real-time mapping. Experimental validation demonstrates that the proposed method significantly reduces mapping errors induced by lens distortion and provides accurate spatial data, supporting improved dynamic resource perception and intelligent management in digital twin construction environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital twin construction scene; dynamic object mapping; field of view (FOV); virtual camera; YOLOv11","Digital cameras; Digital twin; Dynamics; Information management; Linear regression; Project management; Construction environment; Digital twin construction scene; Dynamic object mapping; Dynamic objects; Field of view; Field of views; Generation method; Mapping generations; Virtual camera; YOLOv11; Mapping","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014385459"

This systematic review synthesizes evidence from 64 academic studies to identify the most influential tools, techniques, and methodologies across these domains, revealing both their individual strengths and untapped synergies. The analysis highlights widely adopted Lean practices such as the Last Planner System (LPS) and Just-In-Time (JIT); BIM capabilities across 3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, and 7D dimensions; and a spectrum of digital innovations including Digital Twins, AR/VR/MR, AI, IoT, robotics, and blockchain.

First, in this study, the role of digital-system elements is examined in shaping a diffusion center for gathering information and seeking to model integrated safety information. Then, it offers the data-physics-driven model for automating digital safety systems processes in minitoring construction site health and safety. A multi-criteria decision analysis is used to sort the alternatives. The results demonstrate that the selected technologies are required to gather enough information to shape a diffusion center for automating the safety process in construction management and building health monitoring.

The aim of this paper is to show through a case study of an apartment building constructed in the 1970s, how the innovative BIM platform can contribute to the reduction of pollutants and emissions, reinforce the principles of circularity and sustainable construction, in a residential building constructed in the last century, a building that currently has no digital passporting based on a building information modelling. Using BIM, a digital model of the selected housing building will be created containing information about the individual materials used in the construction at that time. The digital materials inventory developed will provide an overview of the available sources of building materials, making it easier to identify and manage them.

It is essential to ensure the reliable exchange of data and information between the physical entity and the virtual model to continuously realize a complete digital twin in building operations.

A field application study is conducted to investigate conventional calibration methods in building operations, compare three calibration performances, and provide recommendations for effective calibration approaches in real operational buildings. Case studies show that the VIC-DT model could achieve an MAE of approximately 0.35 °C during the winter season in the operational heating system. In addition, the VIC-DT model has improved the performance of digital twin applications in building operations with uncertainties in both physical sensors and virtual models. These results demonstrate the importance and effectiveness of VIC-DT models in digital twin-enabled building operations.

The study first analyzes the limitations of traditional finite element methods in terms of real-time performance, degree of automation, and system integration, and proposes a pre-calculation driven technical route.

This axiomatization makes clear the relationship between game semantics, CPS transformations, and continuation monads. In this paper we extend dialogue categories with 2-categorical structure and concurrent primitives. This is inspired by a recent analysis of concurrency based on 2-categorical monads. We show that the fine-grained structure of dialogue categories, not generally available in other semantic models, can be exploited to give a type to concurrent primitives join and fork. Our main theorem is that this simple axiomatization induces a concurrent continuation 2-monad. We also show that this framework is expressive beyond call-by-value monadic programming. The definitions in this paper are illustrated by concrete constructions in concurrent game semantics, and our results give a formal categorical basis for concurrent strategies.

Modeling dynamic systems is one of the emerging tasks in scientific machine learning. Neural networks have been used to learn surrogate models for the underlying dynamics in the form of data-driven neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs). While most dynamical mechanical systems have some degree of nonlinearity within their dynamics, neural networks have shown potential in approximating dynamic systems with nonlinearities. However, despite the universal approximation capability of neural networks, this paper argues that by adding physics-aware nonlinear functions to the neural network model, the modeling accuracy of the neural network can be increased. In this paper, the construction of the nonlinear continuous-time state-space neural network (NLCSNN) is presented. The proposed approach can be used as a data-driven method for digital twin construction for monitoring, prediction, and reliability assessment. The NLCSNN improves upon the previously established continuous-time state-space neural network by increasing sensitivity to nonlinearity. The proposed NLCSNN is trained and validated using numerical and experimental examples, with results compared against those from several existing methodologies. Validation results show that the NLCSNN model can learn complex engineering dynamics without explicit knowledge of the underlying system. The modeling performance of the proposed data-driven approach outperforms a purely physics-based model, with results comparable to hybrid models. Additionally, the NLCSNN model achieved higher accuracy than the continuous-time state-space neural network (CSNN) model. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Differential equations; Digital twin; Dynamic systems; Neural networks","Continous time; Dynamics models; Learn+; Mechanical systems; Modeling of mechanical system; Neural network model; Neural-networks; Nonlinear physics; State-space; System models; Continuous time systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218418462"

While DT adoption has been accelerated by advancements in Building Information Modelling (BIM), the Internet of Things (IoT), and data analytics, significant challenges persist—most notably, high initial investment costs and integration complexities. Synthesising the literature from 2016 onwards, this review identifies sector-specific barriers, regulatory burdens, and a lack of standardisation as key factors constituting DT implementation costs. Despite these hurdles, DTs demonstrate strong potential for enhancing construction productivity, optimising lifecycle asset management, and enabling predictive maintenance, ultimately reducing operational expenditures and improving long-term financial performance. Case studies reveal cost efficiencies achieved through DTs in modular construction, energy optimisation, and infrastructure management. However, limited financial resources and digital skills continue to constrain the uptake across the sector, with various extents of impact. This paper calls for the development of unified standards, innovative public–private funding mechanisms, and strategic collaborations to unlock and utilise DTs’ full economic value. It also recommends that future research explore theoretical frameworks addressing governance, data infrastructure, and digital equity—particularly through conceptualising DT-related data as public assets or collective goods in the context of smart cities and networked infrastructure systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AEC industry; cost; digital twinning; digital twins; economics; systematic review","Architectural design; Asset management; Digital twin; Economic and social effects; Industrial economics; Internet of things; Investments; Life cycle; Modular construction; Predictive maintenance; Architecture engineering; Architecture, engineering, and construction industry; Building Information Modelling; Data analytics; Digital twinning; Economic impacts; In-buildings; Investment costs; Key factors; Systematic Review; Costs","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011615373"

However, the level of automation and digitalization in the construction industry is still at its infancy in comparison with other industries due to the complex nature and the large size of construction projects. Meanwhile, construction projects are prone to cost overruns and schedule delays due to the adoption of traditional progress monitoring techniques to retrieve progress on-site, having indoor activities participating with an accountable ratio of these works. Improvements in deep learning and Computer Vision (CV) algorithms provide promising results in detecting objects in real time. Also, researchers have investigated the probability of using CV as a tool to create a Digital Twin (DT) for construction sites. This paper proposes a model utilizing the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 algorithm to monitor the progress of bricklaying activities, automatically extracting and analyzing real-time data from construction sites. The detected data is then integrated into a 3D Building Information Model (BIM), which serves as a DT, allowing project managers to visualize, track, and compare the actual progress of bricklaying with the planned schedule. By incorporating this technology, the model aims to enhance accuracy in progress monitoring, reduce human error, and enable real-time updates to project timelines, contributing to more efficient project management and timely completion. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI; BIM; bricklaying activity; computer vision; Digital Twin; indoor construction; Real-time Progress Monitoring","Architectural design; Building Information Model; Construction industry; Deep learning; Digital twin; Information management; Project management; Bricklaying activity; Building Information Modelling; Construction projects; Construction sites; Indoor construction; Levels of automation; Real- time; Real-time progress monitoring; Time progress; World economy; Computer vision","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011600798"

This paper reviews advancements in automation and digitalization within the steel construction industry, framed by the principles of Construction 4.0. An analysis of the existing literature indicates that previous review studies have explored the technologies and concepts associated with Construction 4.0. However, none have consolidated these technologies and concepts (T&C) specifically within the context of the steel construction industry to evaluate their impact on steel manufacturing and assembly processes which was the main criterion for article selection. Therefore, this paper aims to consolidate various Construction 4.0 technologies and concepts to explore their integration into the steel construction industry. Based on data from the Web of Science and Scopus, a thorough screening process identified 56 out of 161 articles for analysis regarding their applicability to the steel construction industry. The evolution of various technologies in the steel construction industry has been examined over the years, starting with the initial references to each technology. In addition to discussing the advancements of these technologies and their influence on contemporary digitalization and automation within the steel sector, the authors seek to identify which T&C are most commonly utilized in manufacturing and assembly processes. The graphical results of this review indicate that each type of T&C can serve as a tool for quality control throughout the manufacturing and assembly processes.

This study systematically reviews BIM applications in sustainable risk and disaster management from 2014 to 2024, employing the PRISMA framework, literature coding, and network analysis. Five primary research clusters are identified: (a) sustainable construction and life cycle assessment, (b) performance evaluation and implementation, (c) technology integration and digital innovation, (d) Historic Building Modeling (HBIM) and post-disaster reconstruction, and (e) project management and technology adoption. Despite increasing scholarly attention, the field remains dominated by conceptual studies, with limited empirical exploration of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). Four key challenges are highlighted: weak foundational integration with structural risk research, technological bottlenecks in AI and digital applications, limited practical implementation, and insufficient linkage between sustainability and risk management.

However, their implementation is often hindered by challenges such as confined spaces, harsh environmental conditions, and cost limitations. Moreover, traditional deep learning-based approaches frequently overlook the critical relationship between virtual and physical signals, which can limit their diagnostic performance. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a novel digital twin-driven feature imputation framework (NIFD-Net) for non-contact intelligent fault diagnosis. The NIFD-Net framework consists of three key stages: (1) codebook generation, where features from simulated vibration signals (SVS) and non-contact signals (NCS) are compressed and regularized using diagnosis-oriented codebooks; (2) mapping construction, where a Transformer is employed to establish the relationship between SVS and NCS in a compressed feature space; and (3) diagnostic enhancement, where imputed SVS features are integrated with original NCS features to improve diagnostic performance. First, digital twin (DT)-enabled models, developed using structural parameters and fault characteristics, dynamically simulate the operating conditions of rolling bearings to generate high-quality SVS samples. The relationship between the two feature spaces of SVS and NCS is then learned by a transformer to impute the SVS features. Finally, the imputed SVS features are integrated with the original NCS features to enhance fault diagnostic performance. Extensive experiments on three case studies demonstrate that NIFD-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average accuracy of 98.34% across diverse tasks. Notably, the framework exhibits strong noise robustness, maintaining high diagnostic performance even under adverse conditions (e.g., SNR = -10 dB). The results highlight the effectiveness of integrating simulated and real signals for non-contact fault diagnosis, offering a promising solution for industrial applications where traditional contact-based methods are impractical. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin; Feature imputation; Mechanical equipment; Non-contact intelligent fault diagnosis","Roller bearings; Diagnostic performance; Feature imputation; Feature space; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Mechanical equipment; Non-contact; Non-contact intelligent fault diagnose; Signal features; Simulated vibrations; Vibration signal; Vibrations (mechanical)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005288412"

This mapping is then used for testing construction site layout planning (CSLP) scenarios of capacity dimensions through simulations.

While scan-to-building information modeling (BIM) is a well-established approach for creating detailed digital representations of physical assets, its application in assessing and improving infrastructure resilience remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by proposing a novel application of scan-to-BIM, namely, scan-to-BIM-to-digital twin (S-BIM-DT) workflow. By integrating reality capture and digital twin technologies, this workflow creates continuously updated and accurate digital representations of physical assets, enabling the generation of various scenarios. Unlike traditional methods, the S-BIM-DT workflow facilitates continuous model refinement, supporting informed resilience strategies. By combining these technologies into a cohesive process, the workflow facilitates decision making under uncertainty, enabling stakeholders to evaluate and respond to various scenarios effectively. We demonstrate the implementation of the S-BIM-DT workflow through two use cases that highlight its capability to enhance resilience at different scales. The first use case involves the Combined Transportation, Emergency, and Communications Center (CTECC) in Austin, Texas. BIM-enriched computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling simulates airflow and develops alternative scenarios for optimizing the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. This approach enhances resilience against airborne health threats in a postCOVID context. The second use case focuses on designated areas within Beaumont, Texas, as part of the Southeast Texas Urban Integrated Field Laboratory (SETx-UIFL) research. By developing inundation maps to assess extreme weather events, this modeling aids in preparedness efforts and informs the development of climate-resilient infrastructure in vulnerable neighborhoods.

Recently, the new vision of Industry 5.0 has brought human operators back to the core part of work cells. To this end, designing human-centric DT systems is vital for an ergonomic and symbiotic working environment. However, one major challenge is the construction and utilization of high-fidelity digital human models. In the literature, preset universal human avatar models such as skeletons are mostly employed to represent the human operators, which overlooks the individual differences of physical traits. Besides, the fundamental utilization features such as motion tracking and procedure recognition still do not well address the practical issues such as occlusions and incomplete observations. To deal with the challenge, this paper proposes a systematic design framework to quickly and precisely build and utilize the human-centric DT systems. The mesh-based customized human operator models with rendered appearances are first generated within one minute from a short motion video. Then transformer-based deep learning networks are developed to realize the motion-related operator status synchronization in complex conditions.

However, challenges arise from non-processing data interference and missing tool wear samples, complicating the construction of accurate prediction models. Additionally, the complexity of collaborative multi-tool operations on precision computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools, where varying tool types and complex working conditions exist, further exacerbates the difficulty of achieving precise wear prediction. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a digital twin architecture for tool wear prediction, based on knowledge embedding. The proposed architecture is designed to predict the wear of multiple tools, incorporating modules for processing data screening, missing value completion, wear state classification, and so on. On the basis of obtaining high-quality sensing data and complete tool wear values, the wear state and machining process knowledge are embedded into the prediction process. A tool wear prediction model is then constructed based on a Kolmogorov-Arnold integrated time convolutional network (KA-TCN), so as to achieve accurate prediction of multi-tool wear. The effectiveness of the method is validated using data from two grinding wheel wear test platforms and two milling datasets, PHM2010 and NASA. Experimental results demonstrate that the knowledge embedded KA-TCN model outperforms existing approaches, improving prediction accuracy by over 22.4 % on the milling dataset, and by 76.4 % in grinding wheel wear prediction compared to classical methods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CNC machine tools; Cooperative multi-tool; Digital twin; Knowledge embedding; Tool wear prediction","Digital storage; Grinding (machining); Machining centers; Prediction models; Accurate prediction; Computer numerical control machine tool; Computer numerical control machines; Cooperative multi-tool; Knowledge embedding; Numerical control machine tool; Tool wear; Tool wear prediction; Wear prediction; Wear state; Grinding wheels","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219687926"

However, energy labeling programs, intended to encourage sustainable practices, often encounter challenges such as data inaccuracies, manual processes, and discrepancies between estimated and actual energy consumption. This study examines how Building Information Modeling (BIM) can contribute to improving the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of energy labeling, addressing existing gaps in current practices. Through a systematic literature review, the research compiles insights from recent studies that demonstrate BIM's potential to centralize and automate building data, reduce errors in energy assessments, and facilitate integration with Building Energy Modeling (BEM) tools for more consistent simulations. The findings indicate that BIM-based methods, including model generation techniques, multi-objective optimization, and digital twin applications, help mitigate the performance gap by enabling data updates, improving interoperability, and offering better occupant behavior modeling. Nevertheless, several challenges remain, such as ensuring data quality, enhancing open data standards, and refining tools to accommodate evolving energy systems. A key novelty of this review lies in synthesizing a broad range of BIM-driven approaches into a cohesive perspective on how energy labeling can be modernized and enriched. By proposing future research paths that further integrate these BIM-based solutions, this study underscores BIM's capacity to streamline labeling processes through advanced analytics and automation, ultimately supporting more informed retrofits, regulatory compliance, and sustainable design strategies.

Emerging technologies, such as digital twins, are being proposed to solve existing asset management problems in the AEC industry. However, the industry perspective is often missing in the evaluation of such technology-led approaches regarding actual applications and implementation challenges. This study seeks to understand the potential of digital twins in solving current asset management issues and challenges within the United Arab Emirates (UAE) context.

Key factors such as particle velocity, temperature, residual stress, and porosity influence the final material properties. Digital deposition prior to manufacturing offers a cost-effective approach to optimising these parameters, reducing defects like cracking and delamination, and enhancing mechanical properties. Numerical modelling plays a crucial role in predicting particle behaviour and optimising deposition efficiency. However, most models focus on single- or multi-particle impact with over-simplified assumptions, limiting their applicability to thick coatings. Advancing digital construction capabilities requires simulating multiple-particle interactions while optimising computational efficiency for industrial applications. Such advancements reduce inaccuracies by minimising assumptions and enabling direct validation of model outcomes. This review evaluates current computational approaches for CS digital deposition, highlighting their strengths and limitations. Results demonstrate that advanced numerical models can accurately predict residual stress and porosity, improving adhesion strength and structural integrity while minimising defects. Optimised simulations enhance scalability and sustainability, reducing material waste and experimental costs. While significant progress has been made, further research is required to refine multi-particle impact simulations, particularly in predicting interfacial bonding and long-term performance. Integrating high-fidelity digital twins with real-time validation will be essential for achieving reliable and scalable CS manufacturing solutions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Additive manufacturing; Cold spray; Digital twin; Numerical modelling; Porosity; Residual stress","Bond strength (materials); Bonding; Coating techniques; Impact strength; 3D Structure; Coatings structure; Cold spray; Cost effective; Current capability; High velocity; Manufacturing techniques; Particles impacts; Property; Velocity particle impacts; Residual stresses","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007065710"

Traditional attitude adjustment relies on manual adjustment, which has a lagging effect. Therefore, the study combines a digital twin platform and a hybrid intelligence algorithm to enable real-time adjustment of the shield attitude deviation. The particle swarm optimization and random forest (PSO-RF) algorithm is first used to make accurate predictions of the shield attitude. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) is subsequently employed to identify the key construction parameters. Then, based on these parameters, a control system for the shield attitude is designed in conjunction with a digital twin (DT) technique. A case study of China's Guiyang Metro Line 3 demonstrates the following: (1) The PSO-RF model achieves high accuracy, with R² values ranging from 0.916 to 0.943 for six shield attitude targets. (2) The key shield parameters are continuously optimized and adjusted within the control range to achieve shield attitude control. (3) The digital twin system provides real-time attitude warnings and parametric inference, significantly improving TBM performance and safety. In this paper, a novel method of combining predictive modeling and the DT platform is proposed.

However, as DT theory and practice progress, a critical issue arises: the prolonged building time associated with implementing DTs. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a rapid DT construction method: LLM-Guided SD-LDM Digital Twin Construction Strategy (LSDT) for multi-scenarios. Firstly, we introduce a cross-modal generation framework. This framework leverages Large Language Model (LLM)-Guided Stable Diffusion- Latent Diffusion Model (SD-LDM) technology, which is capable of swiftly constructing high-quality 3D models based on limited multimodal data. Subsequently, the generated models are transferred into the Digital twin construction framework. This framework incorporates both the DT construction method and the assembly and fusion method, enabling the realization of a multi-scale, multi-level DT construction. Finally, we conducted case study in R&D laboratories, prototype warehouses, and packaging units. The multi-dimensional scoring results showed that the model construction efficiency improved significantly, with peak values reaching 39 % (across models) and 73 % (single model), while usability scores peaked at 13.84. Furthermore, the constructed DT successfully met the core Ss requirements of the scenarios.

However, the diversity of Digital Twin applications has led to a plethora of evolving technologies, standards, and building methods. These varying terms and frequent incompatibilities necessitate a unified approach to characterize and craft Digital Twin models. This endeavor aims not only to streamline construction processes but also to ensure the reusability and collaboration of Digital Twin models across diverse scenarios. This work proposes Digital twin model building strategy (DTBS), deriving four key processes for constructing digital twin models from the perspective of application scenarios: based on physical entities, twin service requirements, physical data, and entity requirements. Subsequently, by defining the application scenarios and employing suitable strategies, the building of digital twin models is accomplished. The DTBS serves as the core strategy for the building of digital twin models, guiding the complete construction process of digital twin models. The DTBS aims to achieve three objectives: comprehensiveness (encompassing all stages of digital twin model building), operability (with low thresholds for researchers and practitioners), and scalability (encompassing not just one scenario, but multiple domains). Additionally, through case studies, the effectiveness of the Digital twin model building strategy in practical engineering contexts is expounded upon. This strategy's strength lies in its ability to maintain scalability while also demonstrating comprehensiveness and operability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin; Digital twin modeling; Multi-scenario; Smart manufacturing; Theoretical system","Building Information Model; Model buildings; Reusability; Scalability; Application scenario; Construction process; Construction strategies; Digital twin modeling; Digitisation; Field implementation; Model construction; Multi scenarios; Smart manufacturing; Theoretical system","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000702689"

In the context of spatially distributed CPS, these connections can be dynamically dependent on the spatial configuration of the various components and agents. In these settings, robust monitoring of the distributed components is vital to ensuring complex behaviors are achieved, and safety properties are maintained. To this end, we look at defining the automaton semantics for the Spatio-Temporal Reach and Escape Logic (STREL), a formal logic designed to express and monitor spatio-temporal requirements over mobile, spatially distributed CPS. Specifically, STREL reasons about spatio-temporal behavior over dynamic weighted graphs.

Computer vision enables real-time perception of the physical world, serving as a critical tool for DT construction. In current indoor settings, single-camera setups are typically used for image data collection, limiting viewpoint diversity when constructing a digital twin for an entire building. Additionally, there are inconsistencies between the coordinates and objects in the DT and those in the camera images. To address these challenges, this study introduces an innovative Building Digital Twin (BDT) method. This method utilizes multi-source vision fusion within an indoor surveillance system to improve the fidelity and synchronicity of digital twin environments. Firstly, multiple surveillance cameras are employed for linked target detection, enabling cross-camera detection and model matching for multiple object classes. Secondly, this approach introduces a 3D object detection network to resolve mismatches between multi-camera frames and the DT model by capturing objects’ positional and orientation data. Finally, experiments were conducted in various areas of a real building, utilizing multiple cameras to collaboratively construct a DT of the indoor environment. The average position error in the total offset direction was 0.049 m, while the mean rotational error was 6.6 degrees. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed BDT framework. This approach accurately integrates physical and virtual environments, aligning the Building Information Modeling (BIM) system with real-world conditions. This study presents an innovative technical framework for the development of digital twins in building interiors, demonstrating significant potential for practical applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Building Digital Twin (BDT); Building Information Modelling (BIM); Computer Vision (CV); Object Detection and Tracking","Building digital twin; Building information modeling; Building Information Modelling; Computer vision; Digital modeling; Modeling technology; Multi-cameras; Object detection and tracking; Physical world; State of the art; Interiors (building)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219554845"

In view of the rapid development of computational technologies, it's becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the urgent need to accelerate the intelligent development of dam safety monitoring systems. The emphasis of the prior studies usually lay in the dam safety monitoring data and structural health analysis. However, they neglect the importance of the real-time interactions of the systems, which makes the presented work not suitable for today's digital age. As such, based on digital twin platform, this paper aims to propose a visualization system for dam safety monitoring. Primarily, the next-generation and real-time rendering technologies are introduced to construct digital twin platform. The digital twin platform serves as a digital sand table to accurately reflect the dam current state and real-time monitoring information. Subsequently, artificial intelligence algorithms and numerical simulation are applied in monitoring data analysis, prediction model construction, structural safety evaluation, and risk early warning. Based on the windows platform, all of the above system functions are implemented in C++, Python languages, and OpenGL. Eventually, this presented real-time digital twin system was applied in a real dam in China.

To address challenges such as incomplete data acquisition, noise sensitivity, and the heavy reliance on manual annotations in traditional modeling methods, this paper proposes a self-supervised deep learning approach for point cloud completion. The proposed model integrates self-supervised learning strategies for inferring missing regions, a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), and cross-attention mechanisms to extract critical geometric and structural features from incomplete point clouds, thereby reducing dependence on labeled data and improving robustness to noise and incompleteness.

For bridges constructed using rotation construction methods, the rotation phase demands continuous monitoring of structural behavior and coordination with surrounding traffic infrastructure. Therefore, a digital twin system for monitoring rotation construction is vital to ensure safety and schedule compliance. This paper explores the application of model-based systems engineering (MBSE), a modern approach that replaces text-based documentation with visual system models, to design a digital twin system for monitoring the rotation construction of a 90 m + 90 m single-tower cable-stayed bridge. A V-model architecture for the digital twin system, based on requirements analysis, functional analysis, logical design, and physical design analysis (RFLP), is proposed. Based on SysML language, the system’s requirements, functions, behaviors, and other aspects are modeled and analyzed using the MBSE approach, converting all textual specifications into the unified visual models. Compared to the traditional document-driven method, MBSE improves design efficiency by reducing ambiguities in system specifications and enabling early detection of design flaws through simulations.

One promising field of research to face these challenges comprises additive manufacturing (AM) technologies. Through these advanced methods, digital workflows between design and fabrication can be implemented to optimise the form and structure, unlocking new architectural freedom while ensuring sustainability and efficiency. However, to drive this transformation in construction, the new technologies must be investigated in large-scale applications. One of these fast-emerging AM techniques is Shotcrete 3D Printing (SC3DP). The present research documents the 1:1 scale manufacturing process, from digital to real, of a building section utilising SC3DP. A workflow and production steps, spanning from design over manufacturing to assembly, are introduced. The architectural design, reinforced by computational methods, was iteratively refined to adapt to manufacturing constraints. The paper also emphasises the importance of a digital twin in ensuring seamless data integration and real-time adjustments during construction. By incorporating reinforcement techniques such as short rebar insertion and robotic fibre winding, this study demonstrates the structural capabilities achievable with SC3DP. In summary, the implementation of comprehensive digital workflows utilising computational design, automated data acquisition and data flow, as well as robotic fabrication is presented to demonstrate the potential of AM methods in construction.

However, in certain areas limited by production capacity, conditions for implementing fully automated production lines are not met, and semi-automated production lines with human–machine collaboration are commonly adopted. The intervention of manual operations and the lack of sensors make the integration of digital twin technology in such systems challenging. To address these issues, this study proposes a framework for a digital twin system driven by an assembly action sequence database. The construction of this system is divided into three steps: First, an action sequence database is established by integrating design for assembly rules to create structured sequences of assembly actions. Second, control nodes are created by utilizing sensor information and virtual collisions to manage the transformation of assembly action sequences. Third, the digital twin is realized by controlling the conversion of assembly actions based on node information changes. Finally, the feasibility of this method is validated through the establishment of a digital twin system for the hydraulic cylinder assembly station, showing that the semi-automated assembly line deployed with this method has the following advantages: First, the introduction of the concept of virtual signals resolves the issue of synchronization between physical and virtual movements due to collisions. Second, the assembly action sequence database can assess the assembly processes for different product models on the same line. Third, the digital twin system synchronizes and prompts 3D operations based on action sequences, significantly reducing the training time for assembly personnel. Lastly, the proposed control method for the digital twin system based on finite state machines provides an effective solution for integrating computer graphics with digital twin systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assembly action sequence database; Digital assembly; Digital twin; Human–machine collaboration","Assembly machines; Office automation; Action sequences; Assembly action sequence database; Automated productions; Digital assembly; Fully automated; Human-machine collaboration; Production line; Real-time prediction; Sequence database; Systems-driven; Digital control systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003958221"

However, these methods are usually trained in fully annotated source domains and applied to sparse onsite scenarios, leading to weak-shot learning problems. To fully explore the potential state representation from the source domain annotated by the mechanism simulation model, an innovative knowledge graph-based data-model-interaction framework is proposed for solving weak-shot onsite FTU health condition assessment. First, based on the selected critical onsite monitoring data, the pseudo-data obtained from the computational fluid dynamics calculation of the mechanism digital-twin (DT) model are used to fully annotate source domain. Secondly, the mixed pseudo-actual data are converted into graphs by node similarities to capture the correlations between signals. The explicit edge connection relationships in the graph structure allow state sharing across domain nodes and suppress loss of accuracy due to differences in domain distribution. Then, a transferable graph constructor with cross-domain parameter sharing is designed to learn knowledge-based construction strategies from the fully annotated source domain. Further, the transfer of state knowledge from theoretical domain to actual domain can further strengthen the sample's representation in weak-shot domain. Finally, a graph-driven health benchmark model (HBM) is constructed to excavate the reconstruction-enhanced knowledge graphs, achieving FTU state presentation and degradation assessment. The proposed method has been applied in a dataset collected from onsite FTU, which not only achieves the best performance in multiple SOTA comparison tests, but also has an acceptable time consumption (5.24 s/100 graphs), and has the possibility of industrial field deployment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data-model-interactive; Francis turbine units; Graph representation learning; Health condition assessment; Weak-short learning","Inference engines; Knowledge acquisition; Condition assessments; Data-model-interactive; Franci turbine unit; Graph representation; Graph representation learning; Health condition; Health condition assessment; Model interaction; Turbine unit; Weak-short learning; Knowledge graph","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003805206"

To address these issues, this study proposes a method for rapid state updates of shape features and the construction of an error propagation knowledge graph, enabling dynamic control in a multi-process machining digital twin system. First, a state update method based on multi-level voxel computation is introduced, utilizing the transformation relationship between cutter-workpiece engagement (CWE) and voxels to ensure rapid updates of multi-process digital twin models. Second, digital threads for multi-process machining are developed to identify machining states and track errors. To analyze error evolution and implement effective control measures, an error propagation knowledge graph based on Taylor expansion model is constructed, enabling closed-loop control. Finally, the proposed system was validated for its advancement in error control and closed-loop optimization through the machining of typical multi-process components in the transportation field. The results of comparative experiments and ablation experiments indicate that the error updating efficiency based on multi-level voxel computation threads improved by an average of 59.26% compared to other benchmarks.

To improve the management efficiency of these complex systems, digital twins (DTs) that reflect the as-is conditions of facilities are increasingly being adopted. To generate DT models, laser scanners are widely used to capture as-built environments in the form of high-resolution images and dense 3D measurements. However, existing scan-to-BIM methods primarily produce basic geometric models, lacking detailed descriptive attributes of the components. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an informative DT model generation method for MEP systems based on fine-grained object recognition and object-aware scan-vs-BIM. The proposed method adopts a few-shot learning strategy to detect target objects in complex 3D environments and identify their family types based on vision foundation models. Following this, the association between as-designed components and as-built installations is formulated as a bipartite graph matching problem, which is solved using the Hungarian algorithm. This enables the automated updating of as-designed models into as-built DT models. Notably, the proposed association method is robust and applicable to components with significant installation deviations, a common challenge in MEP systems. The feasibility of the proposed approach was validated through experiments conducted on two construction sites in Hong Kong. Results demonstrated that the proposed approach significantly enhanced the accuracy of the scan-vs-BIM of MEP systems, thereby enabling informative DT model generation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Twin Model; Laser Scanning; MEP System; Scan-to-BIM; Scan-vs-BIM; Vision Foundation Model","Imaging systems; Object detection; Photomapping; Digital twin model; Electrical systems; Fine grained; Foundation models; Laser scanning; Mechanical systems; Plumbing Systems; Scan-to-BIM; Scan-vs-BIM; Vision foundation model; Laser applications","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003559301"

This issue is evident in the construction safety domain, where advanced risk analysis tools provide detailed insights to hazards but can be overwhelming. Similar challenges exist in cost estimation, schedule evaluation, progress monitoring, and quality compliance checking. Decision-making in construction scheduling struggles to assess how changes impact site safety due to insufficient information and knowledge extraction capabilities, especially when it comes to cross-domain knowledge extraction.

By leveraging Digital Twins, automated safety analysis, and knowledge representation, we enable decision-makers to gain deeper insights into their domain and understand the interplay between project planning and safety.

A digital avatar is an abstract and intuitive representation of a cloud service based on semaphore-based structures and insight lists about its performance and availability status to support decision-making processes in risky/disturbing sudden scenarios. A digital avatar is an extension of the digital twin conceptualization implemented by using Web of Things (WoT) human-machine interfaces, allowing organizations to interact with their cloud services to react to unexpected performance events. We developed Davatar as a construction and management method for organizations to create digital avatars at a high level without worrying about implementation details. These avatars discover components of their assigned cloud service by mining the configuration files and producing an information model of its environment and context. An avatar keeps monitoring the resources used by its applications and automatically builds the performance status representation of these components. In runtime, an avatar exposes its functionality by means of WoT cards for end-users, then other digital avatars or applications can use these functions for interact with the represented cloud service and its components. We implemented a fully functional prototype to conduct an experimental evaluation and a study case based on multi-container cloud services for processing and classifying climate data by using clustering algorithms. The evaluation revealed the efficacy of the Davatar method to build digital avatars without examining or modifying the original cloud service code. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Architectural pattern; Cloud services; Digital twins; Microservices; Monitoring","Cloud platforms; Information management; Multiprocessing systems; Architectural pattern; Cloud services; Decision-making process; Human Machine Interface; Information processing and management; Management method; Microservice; Performance; Processing method; Service-based; Decision making","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214887894"

This integration is gaining recognition for its potential to enhance construction project information management, thereby contributing to improved cost management in construction. Similarly, quantity surveyor (QS) plays a key role in construction projects by estimating and monitoring construction costs. Consequently, this research aims to explore redefining the role of QSs by integrating CPS. Design/methodology/approach: The research adopted an interpretivism stance to collect and analyse data. Two rounds of 21 and 19 semi-structured interviews were conducted, with experts selected through heterogeneous purposive sampling. Code-based content analysis was used to analyse the data using NVivo12. MS Visio data visualisation tool was used to present the findings. Findings: It is empirically proven the potential of CPS to facilitate nine key roles of QSs in all stages of the RIBA plan of work through the identification of 15 CPS applications and technologies. Nine key roles of QSs that CPS can facilitate were identified as preliminary estimation, measurement and quantification, contract administration, preparation of BOQ, interim valuation and payments, tender and contract documentation, cost planning, cost control and procurement advice. The study explored how adopting CPS technologies can transform traditional quantity surveying practices and enhance their value within the construction industry. Originality/value: The findings add to the body of knowledge by redefining the role of QS through the integration of CPS for the first time and then by highlighting the usages of CPS in the construction industry rather than limiting it to a specific sector of the construction industry, as previous studies have done. This research uncovers several other research arenas on CPS as being the very first research to evaluate CPS to facilitate key roles of QSs. The findings can enhance the awareness and the practical implementation of CPS by intervening to form more partnerships among application developers and industry leaders. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Applications; Cyber-physical systems; Key roles; Quantity surveyors; RIBA","Cost estimating; Cyber Physical System; Data visualization; Embedded systems; Information management; Integration; Project management; Surveying; Construction projects; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Key role; Physical environments; Project information management; Quantity surveyor; RIBA; Synergistic integration; Virtual models; Construction industry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002298685"

Thus, this paper aims to review existing studies on CPS and DTs for CB to propose a comprehensive system architecture that considers human-environment interactions. Design/methodology/approach: Scientometric analysis and content analysis were adopted for this study. Findings: The scientometric analysis of 1,042 journal papers showed the major themes of CPS/DTs for CB, and these can be categorized into three key technologies to realize CB in the AECO community: CPS, DTs and cognitive computing (CC). Content analysis of 44 relevant publications in the built environment assisted in understanding and evidently confirming the claim of this study on the integration of CPS and DTs for CB in construction by also involving the CC. It is found and confirmed that CB can be realized with CPS and DTs along with the CC. A CB system architecture (CBSA) is proposed from the three key technologies considering the human-environment interactions in the loop. The study discovered the potential applications of the CBSA across the building lifecycle phases, including the design, construction and operations and maintenance, with the potential promise of endowing resilience, intelligence, greater efficiency and self-adaptiveness. Based on the findings of the review, four research directions are proposed: human-environment interactions, CB for sustainable building performance, CB concept for modular buildings and moving beyond CB. Originality/value: This study stands out for comprehensively surveying the intellectual core and the landscape of the general body of knowledge on CPS/DTs for CB in the built environment. It makes a distinctive contribution to knowledge as it does not only propose CBSA by integrating CPS and DTs along with CC but also suggests some potential practical applications.

The condition monitoring technique based on graph theory can provide an overall reliability assessment and thus guide DT model updating. However, most existing studies constructed graph topology merely based on data information without incorporating prior engineering knowledge, which restricts the performance of such approaches. To tackle this limitation, a novel graph construction paradigm based on the mechanism of performance degradation and fault propagation is developed in this study. On this basis, unsupervised learning is further combined to form a dynamic spatio-temporal graph based condition monitoring framework for DT consistency retention. Specifically, the spatial dependencies of multi-sensors are quantified based on the evolution of the fault-related frequency band, and then multidomain features are assigned to each graph node. After that, the spatio-temporal graph set is fed to a dual-decoder graph autoencoder to extract the essential features of normal conditions, where a domain adaptation module is introduced to eliminate environmental effects. Hypothesis testing is conducted at last to inspect the machine state over time and make the final decision. Validation and comprehensive comparison experiments were carried out on two engineering scenarios with different scales (component and system level). The Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) was employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the results revealed the great potential of the proposed framework for DT consistency retention. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Condition monitoring; Digital twin; Graph autoencoder; Spatio-temporal graph","Knowledge graph; Auto encoders; Condition; Engineering applications; Graph autoencoder; Graph-based; Monitoring frameworks; Monitoring techniques; Reliability assessments; Retention strategies; Spatio-temporal graphs; Graph theory","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217219755"

Using data from 385 academic publications in the Scopus database, VOSviewer was applied to create, visualize, and analyze maps of countries, journals, documents, and keywords based on citation, co-citation, collaboration, and co-occurrence data. Clustering analysis identified five emerging themes: “Tech-Driven Sustainability,” “Digital Built Environment,” “Data-Driven Infrastructure,” “Digital Transformation in Heritage Maintenance,” and “Digital Integration for Architectural Efficiency,” which were further analyzed through SLR. The findings reveal that nearly 45 % of these publications were produced in the last 16 months, reflecting the field's accelerating growth and collaborative nature, with an average of four authors per publication. However, the dominance of conference papers over peer-reviewed journal articles and the limited contributions from regions such as the Middle East, Africa, and South America indicate gaps in research coverage and geographic representation.

A systematic literature review was conducted, retrieving 1698 documents from Scopus and Web of Science using keywords related to digital twins, construction, permitting, and compliance checking, where the PICO framework was applied, focusing on four key aspects: Population (construction industry), Intervention (digital twins), Comparison (traditional methods), and Outcome (efficiency and quality improvements in construction).

With the increasing demand for high-quality steel, there is an increasing demand for monitoring and controlling the status of the converter during the smelting process. Compared to other manufacturing industries, such as food processing and textile, converter steelmaking requires a larger keep-out zone due to its ultra-high temperatures and harsh smelting environment. This makes it difficult for personnel to fully understand, analyze, and manage the smelting process, resulting in low production efficiency and the inability to achieve consistently high-quality results. Aiming at the low virtual visualization level and insufficient monitoring ability of the converter steelmaking process, a process management method based on digital twin technology is proposed. Firstly, a digital twin system framework for full-process monitoring of converter steelmaking is proposed based on the analysis of the process characteristics of converter steelmaking. The proposed framework provides critical enabling technologies such as point cloud-based digital twin model construction, visual display, and steel endpoint analysis and prediction, to support full-process, high-fidelity intelligent monitoring. After conducting experiments, a digital twin-driven smelting process management system was developed to manage the entire smelting process. The system has proven to be effective as it increased the monthly production capacity by 77.7%. The waste of smelting materials has also been greatly reduced from 34% without the system to 7.8% with the system. Based on these results, it is evident that this system significantly enhances smelting efficiency and reduces both the costs and waste associated with the process. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Converter steelmaking; Digital twin; Information perception; Process management","Food processing; Process monitoring; Production efficiency; Quality control; Smelting; Textile industry; Converter steelmaking; High quality steels; Information perception; Key equipment; Management method; Manufacturing industries; Monitoring and controlling; Process management; Smelting process; Steel manufacturing; Steelmaking","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002913601"

However, the complex surfaces, thin-walled structures and time-varying characteristics of the blade machining process bring great challenges. The existing methods are either for simple structures or unadaptable to the continuous variation of the modal parameters, which cannot meet the requirements of online prediction for complex blade machining. To this end, this paper constructs a generative adversarial network with two output branches. By taking geometric information as input, online prediction of the modal parameters during the machining of complex thin-walled blades is realized. Considering the deviation between measured and predicted frequencies, an eXtreme Gradient Boosting model is established to modify the frequency branch of the network, which enables the model to be adaptive to machining uncertainties. By integrating the proposed network into the self-developed computer-aided manufacturing software, a digital shadow system of modal parameters prediction during blade machining is constructed. The verification experiments show that the calculation time of the proposed model is 1.35 s. The results demonstrate that the above system can achieve high-performance online prediction of modal parameters in the thin-walled complex blade machining process. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital model; Generative adversarial architecture; Modal parameters; Online prediction; Thin-wall blades","Complex networks; Computer aided instruction; Computer aided manufacturing; Deep learning; E-learning; Forecasting; Generative adversarial networks; Machining centers; Online systems; Thin walled structures; Turbomachine blades; Digital modeling; Dynamics characteristic; Generative adversarial architecture; Learning models; Machining Process; Modal parameters; Online prediction; Thin walls; Thin-wall blade; Thin-walled; Modal analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002905074"

Therefore, this study aims to assess the current status of Digital Twin development in Indonesia from the perspective of stakeholders, focusing on their level of understanding, the potential, and the challenges of its implementation. Through a survey of 99 respondents representing construction stakeholders from various regions in Indonesia, this study reveals that Digital Twin technology in the Indonesian construction sector is still in its early stages of development. This is evident from the levels of understanding of the definition and benefits, which only reach 16.2% and 22.2%, respectively. Regarding potential, most respondents believe that Digital Twin can address construction challenges such as efficiency, simulation, and decision-making support (95%). Concerning challenges, respondents' opinions generally fall into categories such as human resources (40.7%), infrastructure (29.1%), costs (12.8%), socialization (12.8%), regulations (3.5%), and data security (1.2%). This research is expected to encourage further study by researchers and stakeholders on the application of Digital Twin technology in the Indonesian construction sector. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BIM integration; Construction industry; Digital twin; Predictive analytics in construction; Survey","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002299137"

The Krylov subspace order reduction method is used to reduce the orders of the high-fidelity finite element (FE) models corresponding to the possible damaged states of the structure during service, and a reduced-order model library is then set up. Using the models in the library, the dynamic responses of the damaged structure are quickly computed. With the dynamic response dataset, the damage regression identification model of the structure is established by the MLP-ResNet algorithm and used to update the digital twin following the evolution of the damaged state of the structure. Combining the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and deep learning algorithm, a surrogate model for the Krylov subspace projection matrices of the reduced-order models corresponding to the identified damaged states which are not included in the reduced-order model library is established. Using the surrogate model, the projection matrices and the dynamic responses of the damaged structure can be quickly calculated. The efficiency of the digital twin driven by the sensor data is demonstrated by a physical frame structure experimentally and numerically, and the suitability of the method for a large-scale structure is illustrated with the digital twin of a transmission tower.

This literature review follows the PRISMA method to assess recent advancements in digital-oriented modular construction towards a sustainable and climate-neutral built environment, identifying research trends and gaps based on three pillars: digital tools, building solutions, and environmental sustainability. This review examines the integration of digital technologies with modular construction methods, extending the analysis to circular and bioclimatic efforts, renewable energy sources, and passive building design strategies. While most articles focus on BIM uses, there is an increasing emphasis on IoT applications that leverage real-time data to achieve sustainability goals. However, no full-scale automated Digital Twin was found in this context. Additionally, Building Energy Modelling (BEM) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools are frequently discussed, reflecting the push for climate-friendly housing. Despite the interest in parametric and generative design, the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence applications for sustainable modular construction strategies remains underexplored. Only a few papers acknowledged reaching nZEB requirements despite the great emphasis on passive building solutions and renewable energy sources that contribute to this goal. However, material circularity has yet to achieve its full potential for sustainable modular construction. Moreover, there is some interest in off-grid modular buildings, although further research should be undertaken to analyse the modular construction feasibility for sustainable off-grid communities.

Integrating the Internet of Things devices in the sensing area of transportation infrastructure has resulted in ubiquitous cyber-physical systems and increasing interdependencies between the physical and cyber networks. As a result, the robustness of transportation networks relies on the uninterrupted serviceability of physical and cyber networks. Current studies on interdependent networks overlook the civil engineering aspect of cyber-physical systems. Firstly, they rely on the assumption of a uniform and strong level of interdependency. That is, once a node within a network fails its counterpart fails immediately. Current studies overlook the impact of earthquake and other natural hazards on the operation of modern transportation infrastructure, that now serve as a cyber-physical system. The last is responsible not only for the physical operation (e.g., flow of vehicles) but also for the continuous data transmission and subsequently the cyber operation of the entire transportation network. Therefore, the robustness of modern transportation networks should be modelled from a new cyber-physical perspective that includes civil engineering aspects. In this paper, we propose a new robustness assessment approach for modern transportation networks and their underlying interdependent physical and cyber network, subjected to earthquake events. The novelty relies on the modelling of interdependent networks, in the form of a graph, based on their interdependency levels. We associate the serviceability level of the coupled physical and cyber network with the damage states induced by earthquake events. Robustness is then measured as a degradation of the cyber-physical serviceability level. The application of the approach is demonstrated by studying an illustrative transportation network using seismic data from real-world transportation infrastructure. Furthermore, we propose the integration of a robustness improvement indicator based on physical and cyber attributes to enhance the cyber-physical serviceability level. Results indicate an improvement in robustness level (i.e., 41 %) by adopting the proposed robustness improvement indicator. The usefulness of our approach is highlighted by comparing it with other methods that consider strong interdependencies and key node protection strategies. The approach is of interest to stakeholders who are attempting to incorporate cyber-physical systems into civil engineering systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyber-physical; Interdependencies; Natural hazards; Robustness; Robustness improvement indicator; Transportation network","Earthquake effects; Pumping plants; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber physicals; Cyber-physical systems; Interdependency; Natural hazard; Robustness; Robustness improvement indicator; Serviceability levels; Transportation infrastructures; Transportation network; Seismic response","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000361629"

While the development history of DT in the construction industry is relatively short, its application potential is promising. This study proposes a computer vision (CV)-based digital twinning assessment method for structural reliability analysis, with a special focus on data processing and transmission for vision-based measurements. Firstly, traditional sensor-based structural motion estimation in the DT process is replaced by video measurements, which are used to determine the interlayer displacement of structures under excitation. Then, based on the structural dynamic equation, the vision-based measurements are input into a finite element (FE) model for structural analysis. Finally, the reliability assessment is performed based on the FE analysis results, and a unified visualization platform is developed using the BIM engine. To demonstrate the developed approach, a structural dynamic analysis for a three-storey steel frame is conducted.

Moreover, during the COVID-19 situation, new management needs emerged, especially in large public buildings. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is considered as one of the emerging technologies used to reach a total digitalization of the infrastructure. Nevertheless, BIM implementation carries important barriers with itself like, high software and hardware investments, initial BIM skills training or low data interoperability. The objective of this project is to overpass those implementation barriers. For this purpose, the paper shows the creation of a BIM-based intelligent platform for infrastructure management that leads to the development of a Digital Twin (DT). To show the potential of the software developed, a real implementation in the Civil Engineering School at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid was carried out, obtaining significant results thanks to the actual feedback of infrastructure users and managers. The novelty of this project relies on the final results achieved, obtaining a complete DT for management functionalities like space reservation, live sensors data or assets management. All of it, linking BIM models with own software and hardware development using Internet of Things and cloud computing.

The purpose of this paper is to provide insights into how the development of an interactive digital twin creates a variety of interactions between users of this technology and assets to be monitored. Design/methodology/approach: The development of a digital twin inspection model, focusing on the specific case of a sewage pumping station, is chosen as the subject of a case study. Through the development of this model, this study explores the various user–technology interactions that can be designed in a digital twin context. Findings: Users interact with digital twins by following virtual instructions in a certain way, which creates a “quasi-other” relationship. A digital twin based on virtual reality (VR) also make users feel as if they are within the created VR of an inspection site, thereby immersing them in the VR environment. The design of a VR-based digital twin, which is determined by decisions made during the development process, shapes the context in which users interact with the technology and assets. Originality/value: This study shows that a digital twin in construction practice may play different “actant” roles having different types of influences. Analyzing these actant roles and influences in terms of force and visibility adds a new perspective on the interaction between users and digital twins in construction and asset monitoring practice. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin; Inspection; Technological mediation; Virtual reality","Bridges; Construction industry; Sewage; Virtual reality; Case-studies; Construction practice; Design/methodology/approach; Development process; Inspection and maintenance; Inspection modeling; Looking toward; Sewage pumping station; Technological mediations; Virtual-reality environment; Inspection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001086350"

Since electromagnetic wave propagation is affected by the environment, constructing the relationship between the environment and radio wave propagation is the key to implementing DTC. In the existing methods, the environmental information inputted into the neural network has many dimensions, and the correlation between the environment and the channel is unclear, resulting in a highly complex relationship construction process. To solve this issue, we propose a unified construction method of radio environment knowledge (REK) inspired by the electromagnetic wave property to quantify the propagation contribution based on easily obtainable location information. An effective scatterer determination scheme based on random geometry is proposed which reduces redundancy by 90%, 87%, and 81% in scenarios with complete openness, impending blockage, and complete blockage, respectively. We also conduct a path loss prediction task based on a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) employing a simple two-layer convolutional structure to validate REK’s effectiveness.

Digital technologies have been explored as promising solutions to aid decision making and enable circular solutions in the architecture, engineering, and construction sector. The literature on both circular economy and digital technology fields has grown exponentially in the past few years, and there is a need for a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art applications, integrations, potential, and limitations of digital technologies in the circular economy context. Through a systematic literature review, this study identified ten key digital technologies to enable circularity in the building sector: building information modeling, spatial data acquisition, artificial intelligence and machine learning, Internet of Things, blockchain, digital twin, augmented and virtual realities, digital platform/marketplace, material passports, and additive manufacturing and digital fabrication. In this study, we review current applications, discuss their integrations, match digital technology opportunities with circular economy barriers, and map the digital technologies applications along a building’s lifecycle. Blockchain and material passport technologies demonstrated potential to enable circular economy strategies throughout the whole building’s lifecycle, but their application remains limited in the construction industry. Building information modeling was found to be at the core of most technological integrations, but more research is needed to understand the impact of such integrations in supporting circular economy policies, standards, and assessment methods.

The current study needs more data on CDW industry location. The current construction waste resource utilization rate and industrial layout need to be improved. This study uses statistical and visualization methods to analyze key factors affecting the location of CDW recycling enterprises. Additionally, it identifies planning strategies and policy incentives to drive industry development. The study explicitly adopts global and weighted geographic regression (GWR) analysis methods and uses ArcGIS 10.8 to visualize point of interest (POI) data. It was found that (1) the main factors affecting the spatial distribution of the CDW recycling economy, in order of importance, are river network density, financial subsidies, R&D incentives, the number of building material markets, the value added by the secondary industry, the area of industrial land, and the density of the road network. The three main drivers of site selection decisions are government subsidies, market size, land, and transportation resources. (2) Enterprise industry chain and transportation costs are industrial economic decision-making considerations. Enterprises are generally located on flat terrain, around industrial parks, near the center of urban areas, and close to demand and cost reduction. (3) At the city level, there are more resource-based enterprises in cities with high levels of economic development and strong policy support. The spatial distribution of enterprises is consistent with the direction of urban geographic development. There is a positive global correlation between construction waste resourcing enterprises. Ningbo, western Qingdao, and northern Beijing show high aggregation characteristics. Low–low aggregation characteristics exist in regions other than central Chongqing. High–low aggregation characteristics are found in the center of the main city of Chongqing, eastern Shanghai, and central Nanjing. Low–high aggregation is distributed in northeastern Ningbo, northern Guangzhou, and southern Shenzhen. (4) Regarding industrial agglomeration, except for Nanjing, construction waste industrial agglomeration occurs in all 11 pilot cities. Among them, Shanghai, Xiamen, and Hangzhou have industries that are distributed evenly. Xi’an and Chongqing have a centralized distribution of industries. Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Beijing, Ningbo, and Qingdao have multi-center clustering of industries. Nanning’s industry has a belt-shaped distribution. This research explores the micro elements of industry chain integration in the CDW industry. It combines incentive policies and urban planning at the macro level. Together, these efforts promote sustainable city construction. This research provides CDW location data and dates for future digital twin and city model algorithms. It supports industrial planning, transportation, spatial optimization, carbon emission analysis, city operations, and management and aims to enhance the city’s green and low-carbon operations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CDW; circular economy; land use; spatial distribution","Anaerobic digestion; Banking; Biosolids; Competition; Concrete construction; Construction industry; Cost benefit analysis; Critical path analysis; Crushed stone plants; Financial markets; Fly ash; Industrial waste disposal; International trade; Investments; Location; Loss prevention; Municipal solid waste; Pilot plants; Research and development management; Resource valuation; Roughness measurement; Sales; Site selection; Taxation; Transportation charges; Urban transportation; Chongqing; Circular economy; Construction and demolition waste; Construction wastes; Geographics; Industrial layouts; Industry chain; Resourcing; Waste Industry; Wastes recycling; Cost reduction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218642426"

Currently, most of the existing 3D reconstruction methods are unable to conduct continuous and uninterrupted perception, and it is difficult to achieve registration with real coordinates and dimensions. This study proposes a hierarchical registration framework for 3D reconstruction of construction sites based on surveillance cameras. This method can quickly perform on-site 3D reconstruction and restoration by taking surveillance camera images as inputs. It combines 2D and 3D features and does not need transfer learning or camera calibration. By experimenting on one construction site, we found that this framework can complete the 3D point cloud estimation and registration of construction sites within an average of 3.105 s through surveillance images. The average RMSE of the point cloud within the site is 0.358 m, which is better than most point cloud registration methods. Through this method, 3D data within the scope of surveillance cameras can be quickly obtained, and the connection between 2D and 3D can be effectively established.

However, monitoring systems lack mechanical analysis models and fail to predict and control construction risks. Additionally, the foundation pit model could not be updated based on on-site observed data, leading to inaccurate predictions. This study proposes a DT modeling framework for foundation pits, which is used to simulate, predict, and control the risks associated with the entire excavation process. Consequently, based on the DT modeling framework, a DT foundation pit model (DTFPM) was established using modeling and updating algorithms. This study summarizes and identifies the key modeling parameters of foundation pits. A parametric modeling algorithm based on ABAQUS (v2020) was developed to drive the excavation pit modeling process within seconds. Furthermore, an inverse analysis optimization algorithm based on genetic algorithms (GA) and real-time observed deformation was employed to update the elastic modulus of the soil. The algorithm supports parallel computing and can converge within 10 generations. The prediction error of the model after inverse analysis can be reduced to within 10%. Finally, the authors applied DTFPM to establish an intelligent monitoring system. The focus is on real-time and predictive warnings based on the monitoring deformation of the current construction step and the updated model. This study analyzes a Beijing project case to verify the effectiveness of the system, demonstrating the practical application of the proposed method. The results showed that the DTFPM could accurately simulate the deformation behavior of the foundation pit. The system could provide more timely and accurate safety warnings. The proposed method can potentially contribute to the intelligent construction of foundation pits in the future, both theoretically and practically. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","deep foundation pit; digital twin; intelligent monitoring system; inverse analysis","ABAQUS; Intelligent systems; Risk analysis; Tropics; Deep foundation pit; Depth complexity; Intelligent monitoring systems; Inverse analysis; Model algorithms; Modelling framework; Real- time; Space development; Underground space; Inverse problems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217818966"

However, its development and application in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry remain in their early stage, lagging considerably behind other sectors. This is primarily attributed to the challenges facing the AEC industry, including digital transformation and the lack of formal standards for DT implementation. This study aims to contribute to the conceptualization of DT planning—the early stage of the DT lifecycle—focusing on the road transportation sector, particularly road physical twin planning within the AEC industry. To achieve this, we reviewed the relevant literature defining DT planning. We also examined stakeholders’ relevant guidelines and documents from national bodies that roadmap the road DT planning process to understand the scope and identify knowledge gaps. Based on the findings, mapping the existing road planning process to the constituents of road DT planning was performed for the applicable planning steps. Finally, we proposed a five-layered road DT planning framework that will roadmap future implementations comprising data acquisition, data processing, data modeling and algorithms, data analysis and control, and a service layer plus users. In addition, a case study is incorporated to validate the feasibility of the framework toward applying it further in practice. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital assets; digital roads; digital transformation; digital twin; digital twin planning; future roads; road digital twin; road digital twin planning framework","Data acquisition; Architecture engineering; Digital assets; Digital road; Digital transformation; Digital twin planning; Future road; Planning framework; Road digital twin; Road digital twin planning framework; Roadmap; Data handling","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217801186"

This was followed by the Korean Industrial Standards (KS) for buildings. Despite these efforts, the implementation of digital twin projects faces challenges owing to a low level of understanding of the standards and the absence of a standardized data construction process. Consequently, data construction that adheres to these standards is not being accomplished. Additionally, a lack of understanding of data models, semantic elements, and GML editing methods has led to the creation of appearance-focused data. To address these issues, this study proposes a digital twin data (building domain) construction guide that organizes geometric information, semantic information, and attribute information for building-related digital twin data components. This study aims to enable stakeholders to easily construct fundamental digital twin data in accordance with the standards, ensuring high-quality product creation that meets the requirements. Furthermore, the detailed data construction requirements defined in this guide will allow it to serve as a manual usable by both the public and private sectors. However, the proposed data model currently operates at a conceptual and logical level, which may limit its immediate applicability. Therefore, future research should include expert evaluations of the model and its transformation into a physical model that can be implemented and deployed on the relevant platform. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3D data; CityGML; digital twin; guideline; LoD; spatial data; UML","Spatio-temporal data; 3D data; CityGML; Data construction; Guideline; LoD; National level; Reference modeling; South Korea; Spatial data; UML; Data assimilation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217657903"

However, the current manifestations are merely digital shadows, lacking means for bidirectional data exchange, which makes their use for assisting the construction of buildings much more difficult. We argue that this is due to the lack of a systematic process for developing a digital twin during a building’s life cycle. We argue to look for a solution by combining agile engineering with IT change management to establish an agile, change-driven process for engineering digital twins. Such a process, of course, deserves a qualitative assessment of the engineering process and the resulting digital twin. In the future, it should be possible to obtain a digital twin from a BIM-based design process by applying IT change management in an agile manner. This should happen under maximum automation and life cycle orientation. Our proposal is motivated by several years of interdisciplinary collaboration between civil engineering and computer science and evaluated using the Technology Acceptance Model. While the TAM is not specifically designed for digital twin methodologies, its application here aims to assess perceived usefulness and ease of use of DT methodologies from the user’s perspective, without addressing scalability concerns. This aims to provide actionable insights to guide the refinement of the process model, aligning it with user requirements and achieving its intended outcomes. Our evaluation confirms the proposed process’s perceived usefulness and ease of use, with robust correlations indicating strong acceptance potential among stakeholders.

This study develops a Construction Digital Twin (CDT) framework to optimize crane lifting positions and capacities for the installation of prefabricated bridge decks.

An exhaustive search method identifies optimal crane configurations, enhancing precision and efficiency. Simulation calibration using video analysis of real bridge deck installations aligns crane speed and cycle times with actual operations, improving reliability. Case studies demonstrate the CDT’s ability to reduce crane operation costs by 27% when employing a smaller capacity crane while maintaining operational efficiency. Additional DFA-focused simulations with varying deck dimensions revealed a potential 10% cost reduction by optimizing crane operations and deck design strategies.

In the aftermath of a fire incident, assessing the structural integrity and future viability of concrete bridges has become a paramount concern for civil engineers and safety inspectors. The critical decision to rehabilitate or demolish a fire-damaged structure hinges on accurately assessing the extent of damage incurred. Enhancing the fire resilience of concrete structures is a critical endeavor within civil engineering, necessitating accurate evaluation methods to analyze conditions after fire exposure. Focusing on concrete bridges, this study aimed to establish a comprehensive review of research on the effects of fire, providing engineers with the necessary means to develop guidelines for post-fire assessment to enhance safety and operational readiness. It proposes an in-depth examination of various methods as strategic decision-making tools. The assessment involves estimating the temperature, the extent of damage to concrete, and the reduction in the strength of both concrete and reinforcement. To achieve this, a detailed review of the existing literature on the impact of fire on concrete and its steel reinforcements is conducted. Current post-fire assessment tools have also been evaluated to improve the efficiency of the evaluation process. This study establishes a systematic post-fire assessment review framework that incorporates assessment information domains (including non-destructive testing, destructive testing, advanced computational modeling, and digital-twin technology) to provide a practical solution for accurately determining the safety and operational readiness of fire-damaged concrete bridges. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","bridges; concrete; fire-damage analysis; non-destructive testing (NDT); structures","Causeways; Concrete buildings; Demolition; Fire hazards; Flammability testing; Pressure vessels; Structural integrity; Damage analysis; Economic loss; Fire damages; Fire-damage analyze; Non destructive testing; Non-destructive testing; Operational readiness; Post-fire; Structural failure; Traffic disruption; Concrete bridges","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217531501"

Especially in the global context and exacerbated by Covid-19, the applications of the digital twin have offered opportunities for many industries. While the digital twin has already been widely used in many sectors such as manufacturing and the construction industry—one of the key engines of economic development, is still lagging behind many other sectors. This study uses the systematic literature review to assess the applications of digital twin in manufacturing and construction respectively, the benefits it brings, and the impediments to its application. Based on this, a comparison is made of digital twin applications in the manufacturing and construction industries to draw lessons. This study concluded that although the use of digital twin in manufacturing is better than construction overall, it is still not reaching its full potential. Despite many benefits brought by the digital twin to construction during the project lifecycle, the construction sector faces even greater challenges than manufacturing in digital twin adoption. By comparison, this study drew five lessons to drive better adoption of the digital twin. The construction industry needs to accelerate the deployment of relevant hardware, promote the standard unification of digital twin, explore the whole lifecycle application of the digital twin, enhance data protection, and embrace changes.

The creation and synchronization of a VBM are achieved by utilizing various interrelated virtual sub-models, including behavior, correction, and distance models. To achieve continuous digital twinning, it is essential to manage the VBM with virtual sub-models. However, existing metadata schemas have limitations in describing VBMs representing operational building behaviors within the concept of building digital twins (DTs). Therefore, this study proposes a novel metadata schema, termed the virtual building model metadata schema (VB schema), to represent and manage VBMs in DT-built environments. The VB schema is established according to the mathematical and semantic ontology of the in-situ modeling and calibration approach for constructing and correcting virtual models during building operations, and it is linked to physical entities, data, and applications within DTs. Specifically, it involves: (1) determining classes for operational data and virtual models; (2) establishing relationships for interactions between model and data entities, between model classes, between model and physical entities, and between model and applications; (3) defining properties for each class of models; and (4) extending into the exiting metadata schema of Brick. To demonstrate the proposed VB schema, a virtual model describing supply pressure behaviors in a central heating system was developed and represented using the VB schema for DT-enabled building operations. Additionally, the VB schema was utilized for implementing generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)-based DT applications, which highlights its benefits in enhancing ontology comprehension of DTs in the context of VBMs, improving autonomous problem-solving capabilities in real building systems, and providing better interpretation of application results compared to cases where only the Brick schema was used. The VB schema is expected to enable continuous and autonomous in-situ management of VBMs for intelligent building services within the DT. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Built environments; Digital twins; GPT; HVAC; Model metadata; Ontology; Operation and maintenance (O&M); Virtual buildings; Virtual models","Brick; Intelligent buildings; Building model; Built environment; Generative pre-trained transformer; Metadata schema; Model meta datum; Ontology's; Operation and maintenance; Operations and maintenance; Virtual building; Virtual models; Ontology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209708160"

This study aims to develop a sensor that is highly robust, with near-linear output characteristics, increased sensitivity and superior overload protection, making it an ideal choice for deployment in harsh industrial environments. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed sensor design uses a substrate with a multi-step notch, introducing a new quadruple TMCPS and uses a small deflection model for mathematical analysis. Addition of a multi-step notch to traditional touch mode capacitive sensors results in quadruple touch regions which further enhances its operational range performance. Findings: The simulation of diaphragm deflection in response to pressure is carried out by using COMSOL Multiphysics, whereas MATLAB is used for analytical simulations pertaining to variations in capacitance and capacitive sensitivity. Comparing with earlier models, there is a noticeable enhancement in capacitance, experiencing a fivefold increase. The achieved value stands at 50.1 pF, reflecting improved sensitivity for applied pressure ranging from 0 to 2 MPa. Originality/value: In existing literature to improve the performance of the single TMCPS, a double-sided TMCPS has been developed. To enhance sensor performance, a substrate with a multi-step notch is proposed. The notch creates four touch regions with varying gap depths, resulting in increased capacitance and capacitive sensitivity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Capacitance; Capacitive pressure sensor; Circular diaphragm; COMSOL; Deflection; MATLAB; Quadruple touch mode; Sensitivity","Contact sensors; Deflection (structures); Diaphragms; Integrated circuit design; Microchannels; Partial pressure; Partial pressure sensors; Pressure sensors; Pressure transducers; Sensitivity analysis; Capacitive pressure sensors; Circular diaphragms; COMSOL; Deflection; Multisteps; Optimal design parameters; Quadruple touch mode; Sensitivity; Touch mode; Touch mode capacitive pressure sensors; MATLAB","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207440867"

However, there are numerous small materials in the construction site due to the long monitoring distances, which easily cause missed and incorrect detection owing to their indistinguishable features and complicated backgrounds. To improve detection accuracy for small materials, this study proposes an augmented detection method based on enhanced feature extraction and representation. In the proposed method, DenseNet is utilized as the backbone to enhance the feature extraction of small materials. Additionally, the explicit visual center is introduced to enhance the feature learning of small materials.

However, constructing such high-fidelity DT models of AAV swarms is a challenging task, especially in complex and dynamic environments.

For instance, a significant amount of time is often spent troubleshooting issues on-site when machining failures occur, which reduces overall productivity as the machine remains idle during this period. Recently, using virtual environments constructed in computer systems to predict and resolve such problems has become increasingly popular. This approach, often referred to as a “digital twin,” can be highly effective in addressing issues. However, accurately predicting physical phenomena in a virtual en-vironment can be challenging, requiring considerable effort to ensure the virtual model correctly represents real-world behavior. This study presents a technique for simulating coupled vibrations between machine tool dynamics and cutting forces using MATLAB/Simulink, a widely used commercial software. Machine tool dynamics are modeled with the “Simscape Multibody” function, which allows the construction of a multi-body dynamics model by defining mass, inertia, and con-straint conditions. Cutting forces and machined surface geometry are calculated through Boolean operations between two geometric shapes represented by polygonal models. Self-excited chatter vibrations are simulated as an example of coupled vibrations, and ac-tual cutting tests are conducted to validate the accuracy of the simulated results.

Our focus is on studying a specific security property called opacity, which characterizes the system's ability to maintain plausible deniability of its secret behavior in the presence of an intruder. These controllers are synthesized based on a concept of so-called (augmented) control barrier functions. We propose conditions that facilitate the construction of the desired (augmented) control barrier functions and their corresponding secure-by-construction controllers. To compute these functions, we propose an iterative scheme that leverages iterative sum-of-square programming techniques.

This convergence has led to a drastic increase in external access capabilities to previously air-gapped industrial systems for process control and monitoring. To meet the need for remote access to system information, protocols designed for the OT space were extended to allow IT networked communications. However, OT protocols often lack the rigor of cybersecurity capabilities that have become a critical characteristic of IT protocols. Furthermore, OT protocol implementations on individual devices can vary in performance, requiring the comprehensive evaluation of a device’s reliability and capabilities before installation into a critical infrastructure production network. In this paper, the authors define a framework for identifying vulnerabilities within these protocols and their on-device implementations, utilizing formal modeling, hardware in the loop-driven network emulation, and fully virtual network scenario simulation. Initially, protocol specifications are modeled to identify any vulnerable states within the protocol, leveraging the Construction and Analysis of Distributed Processes (CADP) software (version 2022-d “Kista”, which was created by Inria, the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation, in France). Device characteristics are then extracted through automated real-time network emulation tests built on the OMNET++ framework, and all measured device characteristics are then used as a virtual device representation for network simulation tests within the OMNET++ software (version 6.0.1., a public-soucre, open-architecture software, initially developed by OpenSim Limited in Budapest, Hungary), to verify the presence of any potential vulnerabilities identified in the formal modeling stage. With this framework, the authors have thus defined an end-to-end process to identify and verify the presence and impact of potential vulnerabilities within a protocol, as shown by the presented results. Furthermore, this framework can test protocol compliance, performance, and security in a controlled environment before deploying devices in live production networks and addressing cybersecurity concerns. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CADP; construction and analysis of distributed processes; cyber-physical systems; formal verification; IIoT; operational technology; vulnerability analysis","Analog storage; Computer software selection and evaluation; Formal verification; Hardware-in-the-loop simulation; Model checking; Open source software; Construction and analyze of distributed process; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber security; Cyber-physical systems; Distributed process; IIoT; Operational technologies; Vulnerability analysis; Industrial internet of things (IIoT)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216004609"

However, the open wireless channels and key leakage of compromised entities (including DT and PO) pose significant security issues, highlighting the need for secure data transmission schemes. Meanwhile, it is impractical to directly apply the existing works and cryptographic primitives to DT-empowered wireless networks (DTWNs) due to the absence of a solution to capture the security requirements comprehensively. Moreover, the essential characteristics for protecting historical data cannot be met. Therefore, this paper proposes a security-enhanced data transmission scheme with fine-grained and flexible revocation by customizing a novel cryptographic primitive named forward-secure puncturable signed encryption (FS-PSE). Our scheme enables confidential data dissemination/acquisition between the physical and virtual space while ensuring authentication of the real-time information and feedback results. In addition, three revocation modes are defined. Based on these modes, the entities can flexibly revoke any decryption-&-signature, decryption, and signature capability in a fine-grained approach, thereby providing security protections for the historically transmitted data even though the entity is compromised. Moreover, our scheme is instantiated with a concrete FS-PSE construction and extended to support outsourced computing to improve efficiency. Finally, the formal security proof and performance evaluation demonstrate the security and practicality of our scheme. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin; forward security; puncturable encryption; signed encryption; wireless networks","Data communication systems; Cryptographic primitives; Data-transmission; Fine-grained revocation; Flexible revocation; Forward security; Forward-secure; Physical objects; Puncturable encryption; Signed encryption; Transmission schemes; Information leakage","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214103275"

Nevertheless, in complex and changeable industrial scenarios, the existing approaches of DT model construction and update within the Digital Twin Edge Network (DITEN), do not fully consider the heterogeneity in computing and communication capabilities, resulting in unbalanced model training cost and loss, which also cannot respond quickly to the environmental changes and ensure the data consistency of virtual-real space. To realize the collaborative and efficient utilization of heterogeneous computing and communication resources, and strengthen the balance of training cost and loss in the whole life cycle of DT model, an approach of using semi-asynchronous federated learning (FL) for DT construction and update, named Saei-DT, is proposed, which includes the three significant operations, e.g., terminal selection for model training, self-adaption of local training iterations, and semi-asynchronous global aggregation. Through conducting extensive experiments on the dataset of Industrial-Equipment contained in Kaggle, the experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of Saei-DT in both training accuracy and loss. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","6G Networks; Digital Twin Edge Network; Industrial Internet of Things; Semi-asynchronous Federated Learning","Costs; Critical path analysis; Edge computing; Industrial internet of things (IIoT); Losses; Resource valuation; Solar power plants; 6g network; Cost effective; Digital twin edge network; Edge intelligence; EDGE Networks; Industrial internet of thing; Model training; Semi-asynchronous federated learning; Training costs; TWIN networks; Federated learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212443992"

Currently, DT of the natural environment is in its initial phases, lacking adaptive capabilities and relying on human-assisted modeling. The key to endowing DT of the natural environment with greater autonomy lies in the integration of expert knowledge. Knowledge graphs can efficiently arrange and structurally store expert knowledge, thereby supporting the autonomous functionality of DT. This paper introduces the concept of Cognitive Digital Twin(CDT) derived from the industrial domain and presents a framework for CDT of the natural environment. This framework is centered around knowledge graph technology, aiming to provide more insights and guidance for system development. This framework integrates human cognition by constructing knowledge graphs of objects, models, events, and scene modes. Moreover, these knowledge graphs support agents for the dynamic adjustment of processes, as well as the adaptation and parameter optimization of related models. As a use case, we utilize this framework to implement digital twin watersheds. We develop appropriate ontologies and agents to facilitate the construction of cognitive digital watersheds for various regions. Cognitive digital watersheds effectively fulfill the application needs of integrated flood forecasting and control scheduling.

Damping and support nonlinearity, identified as main types of boundary condition complexity, are investigated by using the proposed method. Both experimental and numerical results demonstrate that the identified virtual force can compensate for the simulation inaccuracy caused by the above-mentioned types of structural complexity, with an average normalized mean square error of below 10% with regard to acceleration difference between the simulation and test results.

The motivation arises from the increasing complexity and vulnerability of CPSs, which are prone to various networked challenges, including random DoS attacks and transmission delays. In addition, the presence of time-varying parameters further exacerbates the difficulty in designing stabilizing control strategies. To tackle this challenging issue, we propose two distinct approaches. First, we utilize the frozen technique, leading to the derivation of two explicit sufficient conditions. This technique exploits the concept of ""freezing""the time-varying system parameters, providing a novel way to circumvent the construction of Lyapunov functions. The second method involves extending the generalized spectral radius to CPSs for the first time, allowing us to obtain an easily computable adjoint spectral radius.

This is achieved by devising efficient computational methods for the simulation of the mechanical behavior of the system. This study presents the first step in devising a Multiscale Lattice Discrete Particle Model (M-LDPM) approach to be embedded in a DT framework to allow for forward prediction of damage evolution in the structural system. In the DT framework, a modification of the M-LDPM is proposed to address well-known issues associated with linking the macroscopic mesh configuration and the corresponding representative volume elements, significantly reducing the total computational cost.

Ensuring patient safety and system performance is crucial in CPS, particularly when detecting and preventing attacks. This paper discusses smart healthcare systems and presents a modified deep neural network (DNN) model that can effectively classify various types of attacks on CPS. In addition, we present a modified Ant Lion Optimization (ALO) algorithm that enhances the model’s accuracy and reliability when combined with ensemble methods. By incorporating multiple feature selection techniques, the voting-based ensemble selection method improves the ability to detect attacks by leveraging the importance of the rankings of each feature assessed in those approaches.

Therefore, this paper proposes a novel methodology for digital twin construction and introduces fidelity evaluation metrics based on a three-layer meta-action theory. First, the modeling process is simplified by dividing CNC machine tools into system level, chain level, and unit level based on meta-action theory, which improves structural clarity. Then, a digital twin architecture is developed comprising the physical entity, information assurance layer, virtual entity, and functional application layer. A multi-level fidelity assessment framework is proposed with general, system-level, and unit-level indicators. By integrating AHP and the entropy weighting method, the approach enables multi-criteria evaluation and improves the fidelity and reliability of the digital twins.

To achieve this goal, this article discusses a sustainability framework combining Digital Twin (DT), Mixed Reality (MR), and Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) to align with circular economy principles in building construction. A case study of a single-family house in Kelowna, BC, Canada is conducted to demonstrate the potential of this integration for comprehensive LCA of buildings. The LCA analysis of the building is performed using OneClick LCA- an LCA platform. The results of LCA account for the embodied carbon, improved material circularity, life cycle cost efficiency, etc. A DT Dashboard (DTD) of the building’s circularity model is also developed, which monitors and optimizes the whole life cycle of the building. The DTD is then deployed to MR hardware - Microsoft HoloLens for enabling onsite circularity analysis of the building. This not only allows for immersive visualization of LCA data but also enhances stakeholders’ collaboration and decision-making. This way the study showcases how immersive DT can potentially be a game-changer for sustainable construction and provides an industrially replicable model. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Circular Economy (CE); Data Fusion; Digital Twin (DT); Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA); Mixed Reality (MR)","Architectural design; Artificial life; Automation; Carbon cycle; Circular economy; Construction; Construction industry; Data visualization; Digital devices; Digital twin; Ecodesign; Industrial economics; Intelligent buildings; Life cycle; Life cycle assessment; Mixed reality; Sustainable building; Sustainable development; Twinning; Co-design approach; Construction practice; Construction sectors; Life-cycle assessment; Decision making","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105016608625"

Although some studies have investigated the integration of BIM and photogrammetry, this integration remains largely an under-explored and overlooked area in specific environment of road infrastructure construction, with significant gaps in research and application. The novelty of this study lies in bridging this research gap by exploring the practical integration of BIM and photogrammetry, leveraging commercial-grade drone technology to develop a BIM-enabled Digital Twin (DT) tailored to road infrastructure construction. In this study, a 3D BIM model of a 500-meter-long road project was developed using Autodesk InfraWorks 360. The modeling process was followed by the acquisition and processing of 816 high-resolution images, captured over four separate drone flights on different dates, using a DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise commercial drone. The photogrammetric data was processed in Agisoft Metashape, yielding a dense point cloud, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and ortho-mosaics. These ortho-mosaics were integrated into BIM model to create a DT.

The key factor in its success is the efficiency of the workforce transforming blueprints into actual buildings and building elements. This has driven efforts to improve working conditions at the production facility, paving the way towards human-centric construction manufacturing. Achieving a safe and healthy indoor environmental quality (IEQ) is among the most critical aspects of this endeavor. Given the dynamic nature of IEQ in OSC facilities, there is a need for real-time performance monitoring as a means of identifying any deviations from IEQ standards and regulations. As such, the objective of this study is to develop a digital twin-based system for real-time monitoring of the IEQ of OSC facilities with continuous management and alerting features. The proposed O-IEQ Alert System encompasses four phases: (1) IEQ metrics identification, (2) data acquisition, (3) digital modelling, and (4) development of the IEQ alerting component. The system is successfully applied in a case study of a wall-production manufacturing facility. A web-based alert system is developed that presents real-time monitoring of the IEQ indices, including Air Quality Index, thermal comfort Predicted Mean Vote Index, and the Sound Level Index for each workstation along with the time-series trends. In case any of the indices does not fall within the defined threshold, an alert is issued to management to take the necessary corrective and preventive measures.

However, the existing work of channel predictive generation only considers time dimension, distribution-oriented or multi-step sliding-window prediction schemes, which is not accurate and efficient for real-time DT communication systems. Therefore, we propose the wireless channel generative adversarial network (WCGAN) to tackle the issue of generating authentic long-batch channels for DT applications. The generator based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) extracts features from both the time and frequency domains to better capture the correlation. The loss function is designed to ensure that the generated channels consistently match the physical channels over an extended period while sharing the same probability distributions. Meanwhile, the accumulating error from the slicing window has been alleviated. The simulation demonstrates that an accurate and efficient DT channel can be generated by employing our proposed WCGAN in various scenarios. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","channel generation; channel prediction; deep learning; digital twin (DT); generative adversarial network (GAN)","Convolutional neural networks; Decision making; Digital twin; Probability distributions; Real time systems; Wireless networks; Adversarial networks; Batch time; Channel generation; Channel prediction; Deep learning; Generative adversarial network; Time frequency; Wireless channel; Wireless communication system","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015402645"

IES performs soil amplification, nonlinear seismic response analysis, and agent-based mass evacuation simulations to model earthquake events comprehensively. This study evaluates the seismic risk of the BHU Campus and Crossing Republik, Ghaziabad, under three earthquakes: the 1995 Kobe, 2001 Bhuj, and 2015 Nepal events. Digital twins of these areas were developed using shapefiles, incorporating attributes such as building height, construction material, structural system, and occupancy type. In the BHU campus, dominated by low-rise masonry structures, five-story or taller buildings exhibited inter-story drift ratios of 5 and 3.5% under the Kobe and Bhuj earthquakes, respectively, exceeding the allowable limit of 0.01h (h = building height), indicating significant seismic vulnerability. In the case of the 2015 Nepal Earthquake, the seismic responses increased by approximately 250% during the second wave, followed by a decrease in the third consecutive wave. The seismic response in Crossing Republik, Ghaziabad, shows that rooftop displacement exceeds the permissible limit of h/500, where h is the height of the structures), indicating a significant seismic risk in these areas. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin; High-performance computing; Integrated earthquake simulation; Seismic response analysis","","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015172852"

The Simulink-based model used in this research incorporates a complete excavator system, including engine, hydraulic, and mechanical dynamics, requiring precise parameter estimation (PE) to handle nonlinear behaviors and unmeasurable parameters like friction coefficients and initial pressures. Traditional PE methods often struggle with these challenges, leading to inaccuracies in dynamic modeling. To address this, a novel hybrid PE framework is introduced, integrating machine learning (ML) techniques such as random forest (RF) and gradient boosting (GB) with optimization methods like gradient descent (GD) and nonlinear least squares (NLS). This framework bridges physics-based simulations and real-time IoT-acquired data, enabling accurate estimation and correction of parameters. Validated using CAN bus-compatible datasets, the proposed framework achieves robust predictive accuracy, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.3921, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0557, a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9999, and a symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) of 0.84%. These results highlight the model’s suitability for high-fidelity applications in dynamic environments. Unlike conventional methods, the hybrid model consistently aligns with simulated outputs and real-world dynamics, with scalable performance across various operating conditions.

Studies have highlighted the deficiencies of a compliance-based approach to ethics management, such as “check-box mentality” and challenges in enforcement and monitoring. To address these shortcomings, the IBAEM, which aims at continuous building of ethical culture, is advocated. The IBAEM embodies ethical conduct spearheaded by the management towards building personal integrity (PIN) in employees. However, the impact of this approach on the ethical stance of professionals in the construction industry is limited, even in developed nations. Design/methodology/approach This study examined the impact of an IBAEM metrics (management responsibility [MRE], internal ethics audit [IAU], monitoring and review [MRV] and ethics training and awareness [TAN]) on the integrity of construction professionals (CPs). The data received from the survey of 149 CPs were analysed using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling. Findings The findings of this study indicate that MRE alone does not significantly influence the integrity of CPs in Nigerian construction organisations. However, through TAN (β = 0.583), the significant interaction between MRE and PIN can be established. Similarly, IAU demonstrates a direct influence on these mediating factors. Originality/value This research investigated the interaction of multiple metrics of ethics management (MRE, IAU, TAN and MRV) and their subsequent impact on PIN of CPs, which is unique from previous studies that used single metric of ethics management. Through a survey of CPs in a business environment associated with unethical conduct, this study’s findings provide useful information to construction stakeholders. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Construction organisations; Ethics; Integrity; Personal integrity","Compliance control; Construction; Economics; Environmental management; Ethical technology; Human resource management; Project management; Construction organizations; Construction professionals; Design/methodology/approach; Developing economies; Ethical culture; Ethics management; Ethics training; Integrity; Partial least-squares; Personal integrity; Construction industry","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014971308"

Cost and emissions are treated as two distinct features, a factor that hampers them from integration in the process to critically address sustainability as a holistically defined goal. This work presents an integrated Bioinspired Morphogenetic Topology Optimization (BMTO) framework which models RC frames as bioinspired vascular structures projecting plant xylem–phloem adaptation to allow the evolution of non-prismatic beam–column geometries under combined gravity and lateral loads. Optimized geometries inform an Energy–Carbon Multiobjective Surrogate Model (ECMS) that enables the use of co-kriging to jointly predict cost and ECO₂, explicitly discriminating trade-offs with ~ 95% performance. As opposed to NSGA II, the Hybrid Quantum-Enhanced Multiobjective Optimizer (HQMO) works along these axes in quantum inspired superposition states, converging faster (by ~ 40–60% search time) and delivering better optimality. Selected geometries undertake Bio Inspired Multi-Scale Reinforcement Pattern Optimization (BMRPO), which imitates nacre microstructures to minimize steel ε by ~ 10–12% while raising the ductility. Finally, a Closed-Loop Digital Twin with Real-Time CO₂ Feedback (CDT-RCF) combines construction-phase monitoring with adjusting predicted improvements and gains, all but actualizing CO₂ estimation accuracy improvement from ~ 85% to ~ 97%. This design framework offers substantial environmental sustainability, from the savings of concrete mass by at least ~ 8–15% to possibly lowering the CO₂ of up to ~ 8%, along with cost savings, all set along the satisfactory line of stiffness and safety. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bioinspired topology optimization; Digital twin technology; Multi-objective structural design; Quantum-enhanced optimization; Sustainable reinforced concrete","","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014147519"

Digital technology-empowered circular economy (CE) practices potentially encounter these issues, leading to sustainable development (SD). Digital twin (DT), a building block of emerging digital technologies, is extensively employed to automate and modernize construction phases and services. However, the broader research body reflects knowledge gaps and evidence inadequacies. This study seeks to disseminate awareness of DT and how its adoption reinforces confidence in CE practices, prospectively nurturing the way for triple bottom line (TBL) sustainability in construction. The study comprehensively and rigorously reviews DT deployment with a customized focus on building construction, delving into and analyzing the significance and bottlenecks. This research endeavors to apprise evidence of DT-driven CE uptake in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), which has launched Vision 2030 to steer its nation towards a vibrant society, ambitious nation, and thriving economy. A four-step methodology is adopted for exploratory research case studies with a literature review. Pertinent literature is collected, focusing on 2020–2024. Subsequently, multiple cases from the KSA are explored to corroborate the phenomenon under scrutiny. Key findings discovered that DT capabilities enhanced with other technologies and tools strengthen physical and cyber systems and data infrastructure. DT-navigated CE shares a plethora of social, economic, and environmental opportunities in residential, industrial, and commercial buildings. This study encompasses theoretical and practical implications. It offers comprehensive insights into visionary concepts for the research community and construction industrialists, nurturing their understanding and motivating them to implement DT for CE catalysis, resulting in a multitude of TBL sustainable advantages. Besides, it bridges the gap between literature and practical real-world practices.

The proposed damping concept mobilises a portion of the building's own mass to generate damping from its differential motion relative to the lateral load-resisting system. In order to assess the viability and effectiveness of the system under seismic loading, experimental investigations are performed using a 1:300 dynamically scaled physical model of a 300 m tall building. The scaled model is developed using a proposed multivariable genetic algorithm optimisation workflow that enables precise design and fabrication while explicitly incorporating the damping system. Harmonic and seismic tests are then carried out on a number of damped and undamped model variations using several ground motion excitations and multiple intensity levels. The experimental results are compared with finite element simulations of both the full-scale prototype as well as a digital twin of the dynamically scaled model. The experimental results demonstrate the ability of the integrated large mass damping system to significantly reduce the structural response, with average peak reductions in accelerations and displacements of about 40% and minimal differential displacements between the lateral load-resisting system and the floors. Complementary numerical studies are additionally used to evaluate the influence of the mass ratio and other key damping parameters and to illustrate the feasibility of partial-height implementation to maximise efficiency and resilience while significantly reducing costs. The findings highlight the effectiveness and robustness of the damping approach for enhancing seismic resilience in tall buildings, with the potential to deliver substantial reductions in both construction cost and embodied carbon.

This study proposes a novel digital twin-driven framework that integrates the physical excavation process with a virtual digital model to enable prompt and closed-loop risk management. The framework combines building information modeling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT), and uncertainty-informed deep learning models. First, multisource and heterogeneous data from the physical excavation process are captured via the BIM-IoT system to form a comprehensive database. The database is then input to the virtual digital model to facilitate synchronous risk prediction, influence factors identification, and risk control. A key innovation lies in the incorporation of an uncertainty-informed long-term time series model, which combines bidirectional long short-term memory-based point prediction and deep Gaussian process regression-based interval prediction. This hybrid model effectively addresses data and model uncertainties, bolstering forecasting precision. Finally, the proposed digital twin with uncertainty-informed deep learning model is applied to a practical deep excavation project, showcasing its capability to improve risk assessment and management throughout the entire construction process. These findings provide a solid foundation for enhancing risk management level with increased intelligence, promptness, and reliability in underground construction through the application of digital twin technology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Deep learning; Digital twin; Excavation; Forecasting; Learning systems; Project management; Risk management; Uncertainty analysis; Building Information Modelling; Complex geological condition; Construction process; Deep excavation; Digital modeling; Excavation process; Learning models; Quantitative risk assessment; Risks management; Uncertainty; Risk assessment","Article","aip","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013758337"

A comprehensive understanding of thermal responses in bridges is essential not only for enhancing the safety and reliability of construction processes but also for minimizing long-term operational losses. As of December 2024, using CiteSpace and VOSviewer, a bibliometric analysis was conducted on 2190 publications from the Web of Science, generating the first comprehensive knowledge map of bridge thermal behavior. The field has evolved through four stages from the 2000 to 2024, progressing from theoretical and empirical modeling to finite element methods and, more recently, multi-physics coupling and digital twin technologies. Major research hotspots include spatiotemporal temperature gradients, AI-driven thermal monitoring, and macro-micro thermal effects on concrete structures. A novel fluid-solid-thermal interaction (FSTI) framework combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD) wind fields with ABAQUS heat transfer modeling reveals internal thermal differentials during cantilever construction and large-volume concrete casting. Future research is expected to focus on AI-enhanced digital twins, the distribution of temperature fields under extreme climates, and probabilistic models linking thermal environments to structural damage. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","bridge; knowledge visualization; multi-physics coupling; temperature gradient; thermal response","ABAQUS; Computational fluid dynamics; Concretes; Structural analysis; Thermal effects; Thermal gradients; Bridge infrastructure; Construction process; Design construction; Global expansion; High costs; Knowledge Visualization; Multi-physics couplings; Safety concerns; Thermal; Thermal response; Bridges","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012736094"

However, due to the insufficient consideration of heterogeneity in computing and communication capabilities of distinct industrial terminals in the Digital Twin (DT) model training, the existing approaches of DT construction/update have unbalanced model training cost and loss in the whole life cycle of DT model, hindering the abilities of quick responding to complex and dynamic productions and ensuring the data consistency of virtual-real space. To address this issue, we define a global loss minimization problem with constraint, and propose an original approach of semi-asynchronous federated learning, named EDT-SaFL, as a promising solution. Considering the collaborative utilization of heterogeneous resources, and the contribution of local data quantity and quality to the global model update, the EDT-SaFL consists of three important operations, Terminal Selection for Model Training, Self-Adaptation of Local Training Iterations, and Semi-asynchronous Global Aggregation.

However, UE heterogeneity and UE mobility concerns impede the DT deployment in SIoT. In this article, we propose a real-time DT deployment (RDTD) scheme for SIoT systems, where the heterogeneous DT modeling and the DT migration are achieved based on personalized federated learning (PFL) ideas. Specifically, we decompose the DT model into the global generalization layers and the personalization layers, based on which we propose a hierarchical PFL (HPFL)-based DT model construction mechanism. The mechanism constructs customized DT models for heterogeneous UEs through a two-stage model parameter update process, involving end-edge-center collaboration training of all parameters and fine-tuning of the personalization layer parameters. Second, based on the above mechanism for DT model construction, a low-latency DT model parameter migration algorithm is proposed. This algorithm ensures real-time interaction by migrating only the personalized layer parameters of the DT model and reconstructing the DT model. Lastly, numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of the RDTD scheme, improving modeling accuracy by 13.91%, 41.06%, and 135.35% compared to the three baselines. Additionally, our proposed scheme significantly reduces interaction latency by 29.93% compared to the baseline. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Customized model construction; digital twin (DT); personalized federated learning (PFL); real-time interaction; Social Internet of Things (SIoT)","Federated learning; Hierarchical systems; Internet of things; Learning systems; Parameter estimation; Parameterization; Social networking (online); Customized model construction; Layer parameters; Model construction; Modeling parameters; Personalizations; Personalized federated learning; Real time interactions; Real- time; Social internet of thing; User equipments; Digital twin; Real time systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012300795"

Mismatches are not only due to partial shading, but also to modules’ construction tolerances and installation mistakes, to maintenance operations, to a different effect of aging on modules, to an uneven distribution of dust, pollution, and snow on the module surfaces. The simulation of photovoltaic arrays operating in mismatched conditions is required in many applications, from plant design to model-based control, from monitoring and diagnosis up to the implementation of a digital twin. Some applications require not only an extreme granularity level (even at the single cell or fractions of it) but also a very fast computation compatible with real-time applications, running on embedded processors. This article introduces a new approach to the simulation of mismatched photovoltaic arrays based on isomorphism. The approach exploits similarities among subsections of the array to minimize the number of nonlinear equations modeling it. The lower the simulation accuracy required, the smaller the rank of the system of equations to solve. The application examples proposed in the article, concerning a PV array affected by a partial shading by nearby objects that changes during the day and a faulty PV field made up of half-cut modules, allow one to quantify the reduction in model complexity and the consequent computation time granted by the proposed technique as a function of the desired accuracy of the simulation results. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Circuit simulation; circuit theory; mismatched operating conditions; numerical methods; partial shading; photovoltaics (PVs); renewable energy sources; time-domain analysis","Circuit simulation; Digital twin; Natural resources; Renewable energy; Set theory; Circuits theory; Construction tolerance; Fast simulation; Mismatched operating condition; Operating condition; Partial shading; Photovoltaic arrays; Photovoltaics; Renewable energy source; Time-domain analysis; Time domain analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010012560"

This necessitates the decoupling of various modules within digital twin models. It needs the establishment of a comprehensive connection model to facilitate information exchange and data flow between different components. To transition digital twins from static showcases to dynamic coordination, a methodology for constructing digital twin connection model based on virtual sensors has been proposed. This method approach utilizes virtual sensors to perceptively gather the dynamic variations of the remaining four dimensions in a five-dimensional model, feeding back these changes to the relevant models. Consequently, the construction of digital twin connectivity modules is achieved, enabling self-updating, self-adjusting, and self-adapting interactions between the five-dimensional digital twin models. By using the digital twin connection model construction method based on virtual sensors, we established a digital twin model for the cross-linking machine in the cable factory's high-pressure workshop, successfully constructing the connection model. This facilitated dynamic coordination of the external four-dimensional models within the connection model, validating the effectiveness of this approach. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Connection model; Digital twin; Dynamic adaptation; Model self-updating; Virtual sensors","Data flow analysis; Dynamics; Electronic data interchange; Connection model; Decouplings; Dimensional model; Dynamic adaptations; Dynamic coordination; Model method; Model self-updating; Model-based OPC; Self-updating; Virtual sensor; Digital twin","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009528980"

To address this gap, we incorporate image data from mobile devices to enrich digital twin construction with greater detail and accuracy. Given the high computational demands and strict latency requirements of image processing, we propose a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)-based framework that offloads intensive tasks to nearby edge servers. To minimize system-wide delays, we develop the Min-Max Completion Time (MMCT) algorithm, which strategically prioritizes tasks with the longest processing time to reduce the overall completion time. Simulation results under realistic parameter settings demonstrate that MMCT significantly outperforms baseline approaches - including Pure Local Processing, Pure Offloading, and the Game-Theoretic Offloading Decision Method (GTODM) - especially in scenarios involving high data volume and computational complexity.

The need for BIM models has increased rapidly in recent years, becoming a requirement for many public and private works. Main feature of the Digital Twin is instead the implementation of real time control and monitoring devices of the physical quantities and their display in a live 3D view. These new design and management procedures are proven to be performance optimizers and cost reducing assets, enhancing sustainability of the whole design and management procedures. However, BIM models don't include any building automation aspects, being devoid of any reference to the communication parameters that need to be added subsequently with additional work and expenses. On the other hand, the creation of the Digital Twin not based on the BIM model represents in many ways a repetition of the work already done during the BIM design phase. For these reasons, this paper presents an innovative expansion on the existing IFC classification, proposing a novel approach to the creation of IFC classes and attributes aiming to prepare the BIM model with all Digital Twin required information on the communication media within the building.

In this framework, the DT model to be built at the cloud is regarded as a global one being split into and integrating from multiple functional components, i.e., partial-DTs, created at various edge servers (ESs) using feature data collected by associated sensors. Considering time-varying DT evolutions and heterogeneities among partial-DTs, we formulate an online problem that jointly and dynamically optimizes partial-DT assignments from the cloud to ESs, ES-sensor associations for partial-DT creation, and as well as computation and communication resource allocations for global-DT integration. The problem aims to maximize the constructed DT's model quality while minimizing all induced costs, including energy consumption and configuration costs, in long runs. To this end, we first transform the original problem into an equivalent hierarchical game with an upper-layer two-sided matching game and a lower-layer overlapping coalition formation game. After analyzing these games in detail, we apply the Gale-Shapley algorithm and particularly develop a switch rules-based overlapping coalition formation algorithm to obtain short-term equilibria of upper-layer and lower-layer subgames, respectively. Then, we design a deep reinforcement learning-based solution, called DMO, to extend the result into a long-term equilibrium of the hierarchical game, thereby producing the solution to the original problem. Simulations show the effectiveness of the introduced framework, and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solution over counterparts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","deep reinforcement learning; edge-cloud collaboration; Federated digital twin construction; hierarchical game; overlapping coalition formation","Computation theory; Deep learning; Deep reinforcement learning; Digital twin; Edge computing; Energy utilization; Federated learning; Game theory; Global optimization; Green computing; Coalition formations; Distributed sensing; Edge clouds; Edge server; Edge-cloud collaboration; Federated digital twin construction; Hierarchical games; Overlapping coalition formation; Reinforcement learnings; Upper layer; Reinforcement learning","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009057152"

While several definitions exist for a DT, most of these focus on an exact virtual replica (often called the virtual entity (VE)) of a real-world object or process, which typically consists of several executable models interacting with each other. Furthermore, due to the connection and synchronization with their real-world physical counterpart, DTs evolve continuously across their lifecycle. Often, however, details of construction and internal structure of DTs are left un- or underspecified. Over time, both these factors (un(der)specification and real-time changes due to synchronization) might lead to misuse, undesirable behavior, or runtime issues, like errors, and performance problems. This hinders the (re)use of DTs and/or its components for the intended purpose or any other future purposes. In this paper, we propose a new approach that helps to overcome the above sketched issues. We do so, in a case-driven way, by addressing a DT of an autonomously driving truck, developed by several researchers over a longer period of time, and with input of several MSc and PhD students. As it turns out, this DT lacks overall complete documentation. We demonstrate how logging can be used to learn the actual runtime behavior of a DT and show how this behavior can differ from its intended behavior at design stage. We explore different passive model learning techniques, such as state merging and process mining, to automate the process of obtaining behavioral models of the DT. In addition, we showcase how the learned behavioral model of the DT can be analyzed further to detect underlying causes of perceived runtime issues in DTs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Twin; Logging; Model Learning; Passive Learning; Process Mining; Reverse Engineering","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008807092"

To achieve this aim, the study objectives are: (1) identify the key organizational attributes and strategies, (2) develop underlying constructs among the organizational attributes and strategies, and (3) model the relationships between the underlying constructs of organizational attributes and strategies. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review and semi-structured interviews with architecture, engineering, construction, and operation (AECO) industry professionals identified twenty-one organizational attributes and thirty organizational strategies. Through a survey, 129 AECO industry professionals evaluated the criticality of the organizational attributes and strategies. The collected data were analyzed using normalized mean analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and partial least-squares structural equation modeling. Findings: The analyses identified eleven and twenty key organizational attributes and strategies. Furthermore, the organizational attributes and strategies can be categorized into two (organizational DT capabilities and technological capabilities requirements) and three (organizational competitiveness and investments, organizational workforce management and training, and organizational management capabilities) underlying constructs. Finally, organizational DT capabilities significantly impact the need for all three underlying constructs of organizational strategies, whereas technological capabilities requirements do not. These findings indicate that strategic initiatives should be driven by organizational and human-centric attributes, including leadership, strategic planning, and talent development, rather than on technological readiness alone, challenging assumptions that technological readiness is the catalyst for strategy deployment in DT development.

The use of digital twins enables the analysis of demographic changes, assessment of labor shortages, and planning of workforce allocation across various economic sectors.

Integrating Digital Twin technology into workforce planning enhances labor management efficiency, minimizes labor market imbalances, and improves the accuracy of workforce demand forecasting. The use of machine learning algorithms, particularly LSTM and Random Forest, facilitates predictions of workforce fluctuations across regions, supports optimal resource allocation, and aids in developing adaptive strategies for the reintegration of demobilized workers. Such models enable the construction of potential economic development scenarios, making them valuable tools for workforce demand forecasting in post-war recovery. The implementation of digital twins in both public and private human resource management strategies can significantly accelerate reconstruction efforts and stabilize Ukraine’s labor market.

Recently, researchers have advocated the integration of these approaches, in particular by exploring the potential for an integrated implementation of the Digital Twin (DT) concept and Lean Construction (LC) theory. In order to contribute to the theoretical foundation of this integration, this study investigates the theoretical feasibility of an integration between DT and LC in the context of construction projects by adopting a mixed methods research approach, combining literature review with a hybrid analytical approach. The following general research question is addressed: ""Is a synergy between the DT concept and the LC theory feasible and beneficial in the context of construction projects? If ‘yes’, in what contexts and how?” As a novelty, this study explores possible interactions between the principles, functionalities, potentials, barriers and challenges of both DT and LC in order to theorize the positive and negative aspects of this integration in the context of construction projects. Preliminary results show that some of the barriers that prevent the full use of LC in the execution of construction projects can be overcome if its implementation is supported by a technological application based on the concept of DT. In turn, a DT application can add value to the process and the final product, thus addressing some of the challenges to its wider adoption in the construction phase of AEC projects. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","construction productivity; Digital Twin (DT); DT-LC integration; Lean construction (LC)","Construction industry; Project management; Architecture engineering; Construction productivity; Construction projects; Digital twin; Digital twin-lean construction integration; Lean construction; Mixed-methods research; Theoretical foundations; Lean production","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007092138"

To this end, this paper presents a Deterministic Communication, Computation, and Control (Det3C) integration network architecture, which is composed of four layers, i.e., end, edge, core, and cloud layers. Specifically, the distributed ICPS domains of end layers are responsible for local training of AIGC models. The updated model parameters are aggregated in edge severs and then transmitted to a cloud sever for global aggregation through wide-area core networks. Besides, we adopt a cyclic queuing and forwarding (CQF) mechanism and design an enhanced cycle specified queuing and forwarding (E-CSQF) mechanism to ensure the deterministic transmission of parameter flows. To obtain optimal ICPS domain selection and computing and temporal (i.e., queue) resource allocation decisions for flow processing and transmission, we formulate a joint optimization problem with the objective to minimize the overall delay of AIGC models. Due to complicated coupled constraints among decisions, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based cross-domain computing orchestration scheme is proposed to reduce computing delay and a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based deterministic flow scheduling scheme is designed to optimize transmission delay while improving scheduling success ratio. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed Det3C can significantly reduce the overall delay compared with benchmarks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","collaborative computation; cycle specified queuing and forwarding; deep reinforcement learning; deterministic transmission scheduling; Industrial cyber-physical systems","Cluster computing; Distributed cloud; Edge computing; Grid computing; Message passing; Network function virtualization; Parallel processing systems; Problem solving; Queueing theory; Resource allocation; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Swarm intelligence; Collaborative computation; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Cycle specified queuing and forwarding; Deterministic communications; Deterministic transmission scheduling; Deterministics; Industrial cybe-physical system; Reinforcement learnings; Transmission scheduling; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005283541"

On this background, digital twins of cities become paramount in advancing urban energy system planning and infrastructure management. The use of recorded energy data from sensors in district digital twins in collaborative co-simulation platforms is a promising way to analyze detailed system behavior and estimate future scenarios. However, the development and coupling of multi-physics energy system models need to be validated before they can be used for further in-depth analyses. In the present paper, a new multi-physics/-modal and highly configurable building model is presented. Its accuracy and reliability are validated by comparison with data from the TABULA project, ensuring its relevance and applicability to real-world scenarios. The modularity and flexibility with regard to the system configurability of the developed building model is evaluated on various real building types. In addition, the applicability of the building model in a multi-energy system is highlighted by implementing the model in a collaborative co-simulation setup and by coupling it to a district heating grid model in yearly co-simulations. The simulation results for the proposed multi-physical/-modal building modeling concept show a very high level of agreement compared to published reference building data and can therefore be used individually as flexible and modular building models including both thermal and electrical systems for future sector-coupled energy system analyses in view of sustainability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Building; Co-Simulation; Heat grid; Modelica; Validation","Building Information Model; Power management (telecommunication); Building model; Cosimulation; Energy; Heat grid; Modelica; Multi-energy systems; Multi-physics; Sustainability analysis; System behaviors; Validation; Architectural design","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004577885"

Drawing sketches on the touch screen is an extremely convenient mode of interaction, and when combined with generative artificial intelligence (AI), it makes the customized data generation and digital twin based on IoT devices more straightforward. However, the scarcity of free-hand sketch data makes the construction of data-driven generative AI models a thorny issue. Despite the emergence of some large-scale sketch datasets, these datasets primarily consist of sketches at the single-object level. There continues to be a lack of large-scale paired datasets for scene sketches. In this article, we propose a self-supervised method for scene sketch generation that does not rely on any existing scene sketch, enabling the transformation of single-object sketches into scene sketches. To accomplish this, we introduce a method for vector sketch captioning and sketch semantic expansion. Additionally, we design a sketch generation network that incorporates a fusion of multimodal perceptual constraints, suitable for application in zero-shot image-to-sketch downstream task, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance through experimental validation. Finally, leveraging our proposed sketch-to-sketch generation method, we contribute a large-scale dataset centered around scene sketches, comprising highly semantically consistent “text-sketch–image” triplets.

Then, an improved unscented Kalman filter (IUKF) algorithm is performed to continuously calibrate the parameters of DT model. Subsequently, in module 3, the subset simulation (SS) approach is employed to calculate failure probability of structures subjected to various model parameter samples, and the generated input–output samples are further applied for metamodel training. A Kriging metamodeling is used to construct the correlation between model parameters and structural failure probability. Once the metamodel is well trained, the time-variant reliability assessment of structures can be continuously achieved in module 4. Numerical simulations on a Bouc–Wen model are conducted to validate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed approach.

Traditional testing method relies heavily on manual labor, leading to low efficiency and inconsistent quality. In this paper, we apply digital twin (DT) technology to the FCST process for the first time. We firstly design an architecture of DT-enabled FCST including four layers to support further development. Then, we present a triangular mesh alignment-based angle measurement (TMA-AM) algorithm to efficiently collect deflection angle data for DT-enabled FCST. Extensive experiments conducted on a aircraft wing subassembly platform show that the TMA-AM algorithm achieves an average angular measurement error of less than 0.1°, outperforming existing methods. Moreover, we develop a virtual experimental platform named DT-FCST aligned with a real aircraft wing subassembly platform. In addition, TMA-AM algorithm is integrated with the DT-FCST platform. By integrating real-time data from the cockpit, real-time physical-virtual interaction of aircraft control sticks and flight control surfaces are achieved, ensuring consistency between physical and virtual movements. The integration of DT technology with the TMA-AM algorithm enables real-time synchronization, monitoring, and unified data management, significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the FCST. Note to Practitioners - To address the inefficiencies and low monitoring quality associated with traditional manual testing methods in flight control system testing (FCST), we firstly introduce digital twin (DT) technology to this process. To support effective and accurate measurement during the FCST, we propose a vision-based method tailored to accurately measure deflection angles of flight control surfaces. This method replaces manual measurements with a non-contact approach, significantly improving measurement accuracy and efficiency. We provide a detailed description of the construction process of the DT-FCST platform including requirement analysis, DT model construction, and on-site experiments.

However, existing researches primarily concentrate on the degradation of the outer ring of bearings. The cage, as an important component of bearings, lacks extensive research. Therefore, this article proposes a digital twin assisted assessment method for the degradation of bearing cages. First, a dynamic model including bearing cage fracture is established to generate simulation degradation signals. Second, the simulation signal is modified based on the squeeze and excitation cycle generative adversarial network (SECycleGAN) to minimize the characteristic distribution differences between the simulation and real signals. Finally, the corrected high-fidelity signal is used to train the proposed selective kernel transformer (SKformer) model to assess the degradation stage of the bearing cage. This model can simultaneously capture the long-range temporal correlation features and local mutation multiscale features of the input signals, thus improving the model's recognition ability and generalization performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through signals collected on real and open-source bearing cage degradation test rigs. The results indicate that the proposed method can produce high-fidelity bearing cage degradation signals and achieve better classification accuracy with limited data. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bearing cage failure; cycleGAN; digital twin (DT); full life cycle; transformer","Roller bearings; Bearing cage failure; Cyclegan; Degradation assessment; Degradation signals; Digital twin; Full life cycle; High-fidelity; Performance; Simulation signals; Transformer; Life cycle","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002595301"

A core challenge neglected by most existing works is that the true-but-unknown obstacles can jeopardize AAV flight security and shadow its communication links with users, resulting in poor achievable rate and high collision risks. In this article, a deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL)-based AAV target tracking and digital-twin (DT)-assisted collision avoidance method is proposed to optimize AAV's communication performance while tracking moving users. Toward this end, twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) as a novel and policy-based DRL algorithm is used to construct an agent responsible for adaptive deciding AAV flying control actions. To efficiently detect unknown obstacles in a flight environment, an orthogonal frequency-division multiple (OFDM)-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is investigated, endowing AAV's agent with real-time obstacle distance. Finally, we present a DT obstacle model construction mechanism and integrate it with TD3 agent training.

This study employs a top-down, data-driven approach utilizing multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms to estimate inverter reliability in a 1.4 MW PV power plant, considering factors such as irradiance, humidity, temperature, time of day, and weather conditions. An extensive alert dataset from 17 identical inverters, including alert types, propagation, and frequency, reveals significant correlations with environmental factors and inverter output power, enabling the construction of a performance reliability model. Dual-stage supervised-ML models are evaluated for accuracy, with the ‘classification-regression’ model by an artificial neural network (ANN) tested on the averaged “Alert-Ambient” dataset, which is outperformed by ‘clustering-regression’ models using random forest (RF) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) on individual inverter datasets. K-means clustering applies principal component analysis to reduce dimensions, achieving improved accuracy beyond the 80% achieved by ANN on the averaged dataset. Second-stage regression estimates inverter reliability with a mean square error of 0.0195 on the averaged dataset and as low as 0.002 on individual inverter datasets using RF.

This paper aims to bridge this gap by systematically surveying DT applications in the automotive and aviation industries and exploring how this knowledge can be transferred to the maritime industry. By analyzing existing literature, identifying key trends, and summarizing best practices, a comprehensive roadmap is provided for maritime industry adoption of DT technology. The surveyed papers are selected systematically following the PRISMA statement and categorized based on characteristics such as single vs. multiple systems, modeling methods (model-driven, data-driven, and hybrid), and life-cycle phases. We introduce DT models using a five-dimensional framework and analyze their characteristics in terms of research object, subsystem application, and modeling method. Additionally, DT applications from a product life-cycle perspective, covering design, manufacturing, operation, and maintenance phases are examined. Knowledge transfer from the automotive and aviation industries to the maritime industry is summarized.

However, due to the low recycling and reusing rate, a large proportion of waste is disposed of by landfill, which has a great impact on the environment. In addition, compared with other industries, the level of digitalization and intelligence in the construction industry is still relatively low. Facing these problems, this paper aims to explore a market-oriented circulation channel for building demolition waste and to achieve it from a technical perspective. Firstly, a digital twin-enabled building demolition waste trading workflow is proposed. The digital twin model could integrate, analyze, and display demolition-related data in real time, which is the basis of building demolition waste trading. Through the two-way information sharing mechanism, contractors and recyclers could quickly get in touch and know each other’s products and needs. Secondly, an innovative building demolition waste trading platform has been developed utilizing cutting-edge technologies, including robotics, big data, IoT, and 3D printing. Furthermore, to cater to the diverse needs of various stakeholders, a dedicated management platform for logistics providers and a comprehensive monitoring platform for the government are developed. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","building demolition waste; Digital twin; intelligent platform; technology integration; waste trading","Building demolition; Building demolition waste; Demolition wastes; Housing renovations; Impact on the environment; Intelligent platform; Real- time; Technology Integration; Waste trading; Work-flows; Demolition","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001512308"

However, it is rare to come across data regarding the implementation and subsequent verification of the utilization of BIM’s capabilities in the longest phase of a building’s life cycle – the operational phase. Currently, various property management systems and methods are applied during the operational phase of volumetric construction. However, these are often systems dedicated to specific types of activities (e.g., invoicing, electronic documentation approval), often requiring a significant amount of manual work. Additionally, current practices do not integrate the systems in use, and manual processing results in the manager receiving scattered and unformatted data that is difficult to use in daily operations. The aim of this article is to present the potential benefits of implementing BIM technology during the operational phase of a facility. The article outlines the possibilities of using the information introduced into the BIM model during the operational phase of a building. It also presents a proposed approach for creating a BIM model for the operational phase.

The adhesive-bonded lap shear joints were manufactured, machined, and evaluated through an ultrasonic non-destructive approach to identify the presence of defects along the adhesive bond line. Computational models were developed to create a digital twin framework that contained structural and non-destructive information of the lap shear joints. The structural finite element model was used as the baseline for this study, where simulations were run until the adhesive constituents fully fractured. To replicate these conditions in physical joints, artificial defects were created based on the defect locations and sizes produced by the computational model for a certain loading condition. Water immersion ultrasonic inspections were performed using a 5 MHz pulse echo setup. Ultrasonic models were based on the structural finite element analysis results, and were utilized to inspect a region of the overlap area encompassing the nucleation defect sites. The simulated ultrasonic data from cross-sections recorded at a partially fractured state shows how the multi-layered construction of the lap joints significantly influences the interpretation of acquired ultrasonic signals. Experimental results backed the computational findings, which highlighted the challenges in detecting defects in the geometrically complex regions; in addition, glass beads used for maintaining adhesive thickness were detectable, thus demonstrating the possibilities of detecting defects away from the transitional region of the overlap length. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Adhesive joints; Fracture mechanics; Pressure vessels; Shear stress; Ultrasonic testing; Adhesive-bonded; Adhesively bonded; Computational modelling; Detecting defects; Lap-shear joints; Non destructive; Single lap shears; Structural finite elements; Ultrasonic inspections; Ultrasonic NDE; Nondestructive examination","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000866549"

The Architecture, Construction, and Engineering (ACE) sectors are increasingly adopting these innovations to meet the evolving demands of the global market. Within this dynamic context, Saudi Arabia has emerged as a front-runner and significant investor in this sector, as evidenced by the launch of ambitious mega-projects such as NEOM and The Line. These developments prompt valuable discussions about the readiness of graduates to adapt to rapid technological advancements and meet the current demands of the Saudi market. Although numerous studies have explored this issue, the Saudi context presents unique challenges and opportunities due to the accelerated pace of change within the ACE sectors, driven by the goals of Vision 2030. For this reason, this paper aims to address this gap by exploring the readiness of architectural programs in the context of Saudi Arabia to meet the demands of Industry 4.0. To achieve this, a comprehensive literature review was conducted, developing an analytical framework. Subsequently, a multiple-cases approach was employed, with an overall top-level discussion on the undergraduate architecture program subjects available in the five regions in Saudi Arabia. A combination of field observations, domain expertise, and evidence-based coding methods was employed to develop the SWOT analysis. The SWOT framework was utilized to identify key strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats within the current academic programs. The findings were then analyzed in a comprehensive discussion, highlighting necessary transformations in existing programs. The methodology employed in our study involves prolonged engagement and persistent observation to enhance the quality and credibility of the discussion. This paper serves as a roadmap for guiding future educational reforms and aligning architectural education with emerging industry demands and technological advancements in the field. Four key themes are essential for aligning architectural education with Industry 4.0: sustainability in the built environment, innovation and creativity, digital applications in the built environment, and entrepreneurship and leadership in venture engineering. It also strongly emphasized sustainability courses and noted notable deficiencies in preparing students for a digitally driven professional landscape. For example, the average program comprises 162 credit hours and 58 courses, with only six related to Industry 4.0. The top five institutions offering Industry 4.0 courses ranked from highest to lowest are ARCH-U11, ARCH-U8, ARCH-U3, ARCH-U4, and ARCH-U15. ARCH-U11 offers the most Industry 4.0 courses, totaling 15, which account for 26.8% of its courses and 15% of its credit hours, in contrast to ARCH-U20, which offers no courses. The novelty of this research lies in its comprehensive analysis of the readiness of architecture program curricula from 20 Saudi universities to meet the requirements of Industry 4.0. Importantly, these findings support previous studies that established guidelines that mandate the inclusion of sustainability, innovation, and digital skills in architectural education programs. Contribution to the knowledge and findings is valuable for educational institutions, policymakers, and industry leaders, offering insights into evolving architectural education to meet future industry demands and foster technological innovation and sustainable development.

Assembly is the last and critical phase of satellite production. Achieving satellite mass assembly is the key to realizing satellite mass production. To this end, satellite manufacturers are working to construct the satellite mass assembly shop-floor (SMAS) to enable moving assembly. However, there is still a lack of a modularized manufacturing system oriented to flexible production for SMAS, as well as disturbance detection methods and production-logistics synchronization methods to deal with various disturbances. Therefore, this paper proposes a digital twin-based production-logistics synchronization system (DT-PLSS) for SMAS. The framework of DT-PLSS is introduced first. In this framework, DT-PLSS can achieve modular construction, as well as distributed management and control. Based on the proposed framework, the construction methods of resource level digital twin (DT), workstation level DT, and shop-floor level DT in SMAS are discussed. The DT-based disturbance detection method for SMAS is presented, aiming to detect or predict different types of disturbances and to analyze the effect of disturbances. Then, a DT enhanced production-logistics synchronization mechanism for SMAS is proposed. With this mechanism, the logistics distribution in the dynamic shop-floor environment and production-logistics synchronization under various disturbances can be realized. Finally, a case study in a real SMAS verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system and methods. This research proposes a practical framework and system which could realize disturbance detection, logistics distribution, and the production-logistics synchronization in complex SMAS scenario effectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assembly; Digital twin; Digital twin shop-floor; Disturbance detection; Production-logistics synchronization; Satellite mass assembly shop-floor","Assembly; Assembly machines; Electronics packaging; Layered manufacturing; Digital twin shop-floor; Disturbances detection; Mass production; Production logistics; Production-logistic synchronization; Satellite mass; Satellite mass assembly shop-floor; Shopfloors; Synchronization systems; Flexible manufacturing systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212771428"

The traditional control method cannot measure the construction deviation completely and accurately, and there is a lag in information feedback. In this paper, spatio-temporal information is integrated into digital twin and a construction error control method is proposed for large-span spatial structures. By analyzing the fusion mechanism of spatio-temporal information and digital twin, a closed-loop control system for structural errors before, during and after construction is formed. Driven by the control architecture, the method of structure simulation analysis and real-time monitoring during construction is proposed, and the functional relationship between cable force and cable length is established. Based on point cloud data, construction error optimization detection method is proposed for structure formation state. The nonlinear relation between elevation change rate and cable force deviation is formed and the control measures of formation state error are obtained. The experimental model of cable truss structure is taken as an example to apply and verify the theoretical method. The construction error control twin platform is formed in the experiment. Driven by the platform, the twinning analysis and real-time monitoring of the construction process are carried out to control the error of the structure formation. The results show that this method integrates spatio-temporal information into digital twin to realize data integration processing. The optimized error detection method can save 30 % time cost and effectively control the construction error within 3 %.

The positioning, pose, and orientation information of objects can be quickly integrated from multiple channels for fast 3D site reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that target objects can be identified across multiple channels and quickly integrated into 3D models. This paper offers both theoretical and practical contributions by enabling 3D reconstruction of construction sites using monocular cameras, which enhances project safety management and supports the implementation of digital twins. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3D positioning; 3D reconstruction; Computer vision; Monocular cameras; Object segmentation","Digital elevation model; Dynamic objects; Monocular cameras; Multi channel; Multiple channels; Objects segmentation; Reconstruction method; Static objects; Three dimensional modelling; Three-dimensional positioning; Three-dimensional reconstruction; 3D reconstruction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205984154"

Autonomous navigation outdoors typically employs GPS signals to enable accurate localization and reduce long-term drifts. However, in many civil engineering applications, GPS signals are either poor or unavailable due to interference and/or multi-path effects. Current approaches for UAV localization in GPS-denied environments, track geometric features such as corners; however, these natural features can be misrepresented due to the presence of occlusions and/or image processing errors, resulting in significant localization errors that can grow with time. AprilTags can reduce localization errors, but installation on large-scale civil infrastructure can be challenging. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework that leverages the wealth of visual and geometric information encoded in a Graphics-Based Digital Twin (GBDT) of a target infrastructure to provide accurate localization of a UAV. The GBDT is comprised of a computer graphics model that faithfully represents a target structure’s geometry, structural features, and visual textures. The visual details of the GBDT are exploited to design an object recognition algorithm that detects GBDTtags, which are distinctive objects (or a collection of components) on the target structure in advance; GBDTtags provide functionality similar to AprilTags. When the camera attached to a UAV detects one or more GBDTtags, the vertices of the GBDTtags are mapped from the image plane into the GBDT coordinate system, allowing for the UAV to be localized. The framework, termed herein as GBDTpose, is first validated numerically using Blender, Gazebo, and Mavros software-in-the-loop (SITL). Subsequently, field validation is carried out using the Kavita and Lalit Bahl Smart Bridge at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Results show that localization in GPS-denied environments can be achieved with 5-50 cm accuracy without the need for physical markers being placed on the structure. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AprilTag; computer vision; GBDT; GBDTtag; localization and pose estimation; path-planning; UAVs","Adaptive boosting; Analog storage; Binary trees; Digital storage; Directed graphs; Electric towers; Gluing; Image acquisition; Image coding; Image fusion; Image matching; Image texture; Motion planning; Network theory (graphs); Photomapping; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Water towers; Aerial vehicle; Apriltag; Autonomous navigation; GBDTtag; Graphic-based digital twin; Localisation; Localization and pose estimation; Pose-estimation; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Vehicle localization; Global positioning system","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205862249"

It can accurately reflect the physical world. In the early stage of building an intelligent factory, it is very meaningful to design a digital twin model of a physical factory through process planning, logistics optimization, layout planning, and so on, to shorten the time of building and debugging a physical factory. This paper takes the construction of an intelligent factory for laptop assembly as an example. Firstly, construct the model of the laptop disassembly/assembly graph. Because assembly is the reverse process of disassembly, the algorithm is used to plan the assembly sequence of the laptop. After that, the digital twin model of the laptop assembly line according to the laptop assembly process sequence. Subsequently, time series optimization was used to optimize the bottleneck process of the model, resulting in a 424% increase in output. Lastly, we explain the modules and steps used to build the physical laptop factory.

Classical modal decomposition methods are particularly adept at handling matrix-form input data that contains columnized snapshots without retaining spatial structure and neighborhood information. Focusing on addressing this problem, this paper proposed a Tensor-Based Modal Decomposition (TBMD) method to deal with the high-order tensor-form input data. TBMD method is effective in finding the potential low-order manifolds of a given high-order dynamical system with low energy loss within fewer decomposited modes. Moreover, TBMD is extended to be used in the field of optimal sensor placement via the development of a tensor-based QR factorization method and a tensor-based compressive sensing algorithm. The tensor-based QR factorization method is able to consider the spatial structure and neighborhood information of the basis matrices data in tensor form. This is the first time that a compressive sensing model has been discussed and solved for the frontal slice-wise product of a tensor and a vector. Subsequently, comprehensive case studies are conducted based on the cylinder wake dataset, airfoil vortex dataset, sea surface temperature dataset, eigenfaces dataset and turbulent channel flow dataset. The experiment results show that TBMD can accurately capture lower-order manifolds, and the tensor-based QR factorization is effective in optimizing sensor placement with fewer sensors while maintaining high reconstruction accuracy. The proposed methods in this paper is promising to be utilized in the construction of large-scale complex system digital twins, in which TBMD can serve as a fundamental algorithm in constructing ROM. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin; Optimal sensor placement; Reduced order models; Tensor-based compressive sensing; Tensor-based modal decomposition; Tensor-based QR factorization","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Feedback control; Matrix algebra; Matrix factorization; Network security; Compressive sensing; Modal decomposition; Modal decomposition methods; Optimal sensor placement; QR factorizations; Reduced order modelling; Reduced-order model; Tensor-based compressive sensing; Tensor-based modal decomposition; Tensor-based QR factorization; Tensors","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203027085"

In order to realize the adaptability of working conditions, the coupling relationship between construction step and structural elevation is established. A cable structure lifting analysis model driven by an improved long short-term memory neural network is proposed, which effectively solves the problem of poor convergence of the traditional finite element method. An automatic time window selection method is formed for the neural network. An adaptive moment estimation method is used for neural network parameter optimization, which improves the efficiency and accuracy of the analysis. Taking the lifting process of a cable truss structure test model as an example, a digital twin collaborative construction platform is established to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the research method.

Through the improved long short-term memory neural network, the coupling relationship between the construction step and the structural elevation is established, which accurately guides the whole construction process. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cable structure; Digital twin; Improved long short-term memory; Intelligent lifting; Multi-collaborative mode","Cables structures; Construction process; Construction steps; Coupling relationships; Improved long short-term memory; Intelligent lifting; Logic models; Multi-collaborative mode; Neural-networks; Short term memory","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202355356"

It is crucial to ensure the reliability during the vehicle-to-vehicle interaction process. Although the emerging blockchain has superiority in handling security-related issues, existing blockchain-based schemes show weakness in highly dynamic IoV. Both the transaction broadcast and consensus process require multiple rounds of communication throughout the whole network, while the high relative speed between vehicles and dynamic topology resulting in the intermittent connections will degrade the efficiency of blockchain. In this paper, we propose a Digital Twin (DT)-enabled blockchain framework for dynamic IoV, which aims to reduce both the communication cost and the operational latency of blockchain. To address the dynamic context, we propose a DT construction strategy that jointly considers the DT migration and blockchain computing consumption. Moreover, a communication-efficient Local Perceptual Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (LPMA-DDPG) algorithm is designed to execute the DT construction strategy among edge servers in a decentralized manner. The simulation results show that the proposed framework can greatly reduce the communication cost, while achieving good security performance. The dynamic DT construction strategy shows superiority in operation latency compared with benchmark strategies. The decentralized LPMA-DDPG algorithm is helpful for implementing the optimal DT construction strategy in practical ITS. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Digital twin; Internet of vehicles; Multi-agent DDPG","Block-chain; Communication cost; Construction strategies; Deterministics; Gradient algorithm; Intelligent transportation systems; Internet of vehicle; Multi agent; Multi-agent DDPG; Policy gradient; Blockchain","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201425456"

Designing wireless systems including UAVs as aerial base stations (ABSs) is a challenging task, due to the mobility of ABSs causing time-varying nature of environmental surroundings and relative propagation paths to user equipment (UE) devices. Therefore, it is essential to have an accurate estimate of the channel for varying positioning of the UAVs. In this paper, we propose to adopt a digital twin based performance evaluation procedure for wireless systems including ABSs, providing enhanced accuracy of channel modeling for specific target deployment areas. Using ray-tracing channel models reflecting detailed building and terrain information of the transmission environment, an UAV position optimization algorithm based on reinforcement learning is presented. By utilizing deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), the proposed algorithm calculates the overall throughput in the digital twin and determines the desired states of the UAV.

The study is presented to show the progression of cascading generator dynamics on account of single or multiple time instants of SA launched on these power components. The results are discussed according to criteria in terms of deviations in rotor speed of the generator and identify some of possible combinations of power components that are most critical to grid stability.

However, traditional LCSA applications are typically confined to the early design stages of building projects, where they assess the entire life cycle of a building using static historical data rather than being employed as a decision-making tool throughout all project phases with real-time data integration. This research addresses these limitations by investigating the integration of LCSA with Digital Twin (DT) and Blockchain technologies to enhance sustainability assessments in building projects. The primary aim is to develop a dynamic framework that incorporates real-time data across a building's entire life cycle. This study utilizes a systematic literature review to identify current trends and gaps, leading to the development of an integrative framework validated through a case study of a typical residential building. The findings demonstrate that integrating DT facilitates continuous monitoring and assessment of environmental, economic, and social impacts, while Blockchain ensures data security, integrity, and transparency.

This paper proposed a surrogate model that combined Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) with deep learning to capture the dynamic mapping relationship between sensor monitoring point information and the global flow field state during equipment operation, enabling rapid reconstruction of the temperature field and velocity field. Using POD, the order of the tested temperature field was reduced by 99.75%, and the order of the velocity field was reduced by 99.13%, effectively decreasing the dimensionality of the flow field. Our analysis revealed that the first modal coefficient of the temperature field snapshot data, after modal decomposition, had a higher energy proportion compared to that of the velocity field snapshot data, along with a more pronounced marginal effect. This indicates that more modes need to be retained for the velocity field to achieve a higher total energy proportion. By constructing a CSSA-BP model to represent the mapping relationship between the modal coefficients of the temperature and velocity fields and the data collected from the detection points, a comparison was made with the BP method in reconstructing the temperature field of a shell-and-tube heat exchanger. The CSSA-BP method yielded a maximum mean squared error (MSE) of 9.84 for the reconstructed temperature field, with a maximum mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.85. For the velocity field, the maximum MSE was 0.0135 and the maximum MAE was 0.0728. The global maximum errors for the reconstructed temperature field were 4.85%, 3.65%, and 4.29%, respectively. The global maximum errors for the reconstructed velocity field were 17.72%, 11.30%, and 16.79%, indicating that the model established in this study has high accuracy. Conventional CFD simulation methods require several hours, whereas the reconstruction model proposed here can rapidly reconstruct the flow field within 1 min after training is completed, significantly reducing reconstruction time. This work provides a new method for quickly obtaining the internal flow field state of pressure vessel equipment under limited detection points, offering a reference for online monitoring and the development of digital twins for pressure vessel equipment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CFD; CSSA; deep learning; digital twin; proper orthogonal decomposition","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210433435"

In practice, problems arise when creating and managing these twins, as different data, models, technology, and tools must be used, and they cannot all be combined as desired due to certain incompatibilities. On the other hand, today’s traditional building management demands a more optimized process to prevent errors and enable timely reactions to failures and defects. Managing and using a large amount of complex and disparate data are required, which is why the use of CMMS-type software is common (Computerized Maintenance Management System). However, such software is rarely designed for management in a 3D format, often due to the absence of three-dimensional models of the assets. This research aims to contribute to the technological development of the digitalization of the built environment, providing a simple methodology for generating and managing 3D models of cities. To achieve this, the tools and information useful for generating an integrated GIS 3D and BIM model, and for Computer-Aided Maintenance Management in a three-dimensional format (CMMS-3D), are identified. The final model obtained is used to optimize the three-dimensional management of a classroom building on the “Campus de Las Llamas” at the University of Cantabria in Spain. The results demonstrate that it is possible to integrate digital models with simple linking mechanisms between the existing tools, thus achieving an optimal three-dimensional management model. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BIM; building information modeling; CMMS; computerized maintenance management system; digital twin; geographic information system; GIS","Building Information Model; Information management; 3D models; 3d-modeling; Building Information Modelling; Case-studies; CMMS; Computerized maintenance management system; Geographic information; Simple++; Three-dimensional managements; Virtual models; Decision making","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210246799"

Our analysis demonstrates that to arrive a to high-quality DNN accelerator architecture, complex mutual trade-offs have to be resolved among the accelerator micro- and macro-architecture, and the corresponding memory and communication architectures, as well as among the performance, power consumption and area. Therefore, we developed a multi-processor accelerator design methodology involving an automatic design-space exploration (DSE) framework that enables a very efficient construction and analysis of DNN accelerator architectures, as well as an adequate trade-off exploitation. To satisfy the low power demands of IoT devices, we extend our quality-driven model-based multi-processor accelerator design methodology with some novel power optimization techniques at the Processor's and memory exploration stages. Our proposed power optimization techniques at the processor's exploration stage achieve up to 66.5% reduction in power consumption, while our proposed data reuse techniques avoid up to 85.92% of redundant memory accesses thereby reducing the power consumption of accelerator necessary for low-power IoT applications.

In the case of digital twins of robotic stations, modeling accuracy and two-way communication with the real station proved to be crucial. The article proposes a methodology for solving the basic problem of off-line robot programming, i.e., the limited accuracy of the representation of the station and the details. The algorithm of proceeding in the case when the station already exists and its digital model is built and the case when the digital model is first created and the real solution is built on its basis is shown.

Moreover, the optimization of the construction process scheme is difficult, and the convergence and visualization of the finite element analysis are insufficient, which hinders the construction efficiency. This study proposes a cable structure demolition optimization method driven by the digital twin (DT) evolution model. From the perspective of virtual-real mapping, the DT evolution process of cable structure demolition is clarified. The virtualization method of physical demolition process is formed by integrating visual modeling, simulation modeling and data modeling. Taking full account of the temporal and spatial evolution of the demolition process, a DT evolution model of the demolition process is established. Starting from the information flow, component flow, control flow and their relationship, the problems existing in the process of demolition execution are analyzed. Driven by the twin evolution process, a data mapping method for the demolition process is proposed. The safety risk is characterized by the mechanical properties (MPs) of the structure, and the expression language of the data association relationship is established. The particle swarm optimization back propagation neural network (PSO-BPNN) is improved, and an intelligent analysis method of MPs in the whole process of demolition is proposed. The best construction scheme is obtained by integrating the changes in MPs between the various demolition steps. The information of the demolition evolution process is divided into functional modules, and a DT platform is developed to efficiently guide the actual construction. Taking the demolition process of a cable truss experimental model as an example, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified. The research results show that the DT evolution model can accurately map the actual demolition process. The deep learning method analyzes the mechanical properties of the structure and obtains the best construction scheme quickly and accurately. The development and application of the twin platform improves the degree of visualization and realizes the efficient guidance of the virtual model to the actual construction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cable structure; Digital twin; Experimental verification; Optimization of scheme; Structure demolition","Connectors (structural); Hydroelasticity; Problem oriented languages; Risk assessment; Shape optimization; Structural optimization; Trusses; Cables structures; Evolution modeling; Evolution process; Experimental verification; Mechanical; Optimisations; Optimization method; Optimization of scheme; Property; Structure demolition; Demolition","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205469840"

Therefore, this study aims to solve the real-time dynamic optimization problem of shield machines and achieve autonomous optimal control. Based on cyber-physical system (CPS), this paper proposes a Twin Double Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient-Model Predictive Control (TD3-MPC) hierarchical autonomous control scheme, which is divided into coordination level and execution level. Based on Twin Double Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm, TD3 agent is designed. A virtual tunnel environment has been designed based on sealed cabin pressure mechanism model. TD3 agent and virtual environment are used as coordination level. A dynamic state-space model for sealed cabin pressure is established, incorporating shield machine dynamics model and mechanism of sealed cabin pressure. On this basis, model predictive controller is designed as execution level. TD3 agent interacts with virtual tunneling environment based on geological information parameters of real-time sampling. An optimal sealed cabin pressure curve under current sampling interval is found and transmitted to executive level as the control target. Execution level solves the quadratic programming through real-time feedback of sealed cabin pressure and continuous rolling optimizes screw conveyor speed and propulsion speed to achieve accurate tracking of pressure controlling target. Simulated results demonstrated that this control approach has a good pressure control effect and strong soil adaptive ability. From multiple perspectives, viability and efficiency are further verified for the proposed controlling scheme.

However, it has recently been deemed insufficient in fulfilling European objectives for 2030. In response, and to counteract the unintended negative consequences triggered by Industry 4.0, Industry 5.0 has been introduced. The purpose of this article is to shed light on how the architecture, engineering, construction, management, operation, and conservation industry can adapt and better prepare to embrace novel Industry 5.0 principles and enabling technologies, ultimately resulting in enhanced conservation practices for the built cultural heritage environment. To achieve this, a systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA methodology. The principal results of this article highlight the work of different conservation professionals and our views on the potential of Industry 5.0 for enhancing conservation practices. Major conclusions indicate that artificial intelligence and digital twins are the two most studied technologies in the field. Sustainability is broadly discussed throughout the analyzed literature, whereas resilience and human centrism require further research and implementation efforts to achieve a holistic Industry 5.0 adoption. The significant scientific novelty of this work lies in the comprehensive scope of the review in terms of principles and enabling technologies, with a particular emphasis on heritage buildings. Thus, it is valuable for conservation practitioners seeking best practices, for policymakers as it suggests ways to encourage the adoption of novel technologies and principles in conservation, and for researchers as it highlights gaps and stimulates further paths of research and innovation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Built cultural heritage environment; Conservation; Human-centrism; Industry 5.0; Resilience; Sustainability; Systematic literature review","Build cultural heritage environment; Conservation practices; Cultural heritage conservation; Cultural heritages; Enabling technologies; Human-centrism; Industrial operations; Industry 5.0; Resilience; Systematic literature review","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202215925"

Sustainable actions are needed to maintain Singapore's ageing infrastructure. Hence, a state-of-the-art control and management system is required in the form of smart city digital tools. We introduce an Urban Digital Twin (UDT)—GHG App for decision-makers in Singapore's operational building greenhouse gas (GHG) emission mitigation and decarbonisation initiatives. Based on multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), a Potential for Intervention (PFI) map was created to rejuvenate the building system. Decision-makers can use this map to prioritise the rejuvenation of low-carbon building systems in the built environment. A heat map of the PFI results highlights which buildings need urgent rejuvenation based on critical parameters. The GHG App utilises this method to generate maps and enables users to modify parameter weights based on their priorities, automatically updating the map. Users can plan an intervention for buildings with higher PFI values once the map is generated. The GHG App provides interactive data visualisation of 119,872 features representing Singapore's built environment, including the context size of 6,785 existing residential buildings modelled and used to demonstrate the analysis results.

Therefore, this paper focuses on the development of an ontology based on an existing steel prefabrication standard to link process data, tolerances and deviations, thereby enabling the realisation of a semantic DT. The approach's feasibility is proven by a case study that demonstrates process and tolerance modelling, as well as linking robot control, feedback data, and measured tolerances for robotic plasma cutting.

The research aimed to accurately forecast the combined cycle power (CCP) output, a critical performance indicator, to support intelligent decision-making for plant operators and engineers. The proposed framework leverages a neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) model integrated within a digital twin architecture to capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics of combined cycle gas turbine unit (CCGU) system. The predictive model was trained and validated using multivariate time-series data collected from a CCGU, achieving high accuracy with an R2_score of 0.993, a mean absolute percentage error of 0.325 %, and a root mean squared error of 1.518. Importantly, the NODE model demonstrated superior forecasting capabilities compared to traditional machine learning techniques. The digital twin (DT) concept enables seamless real-time data integration, physics-based models, and advanced data analytics to facilitate comprehensive CCGU lifecycle management. This novel approach provides operators with reliable, real-time insights to optimize plant performance, reduce maintenance costs, and improve overall sustainability. The generalization of the NODE model to an independent CCGU unit validated its applicability across diverse power plant configurations, highlighting the originality and practical value of the research. The key contribution of this work is the development of a digital twin-based predictive modeling framework centered on the innovative use of neural ordinary differential equations to enhance the operation and maintenance of critical energy infrastructure.

Unlike the data-rich environments typical of structure-from-motion (sfm) technologies, the construction phase of civil engineering projects often faces economic constraints that limit data collection. This results in sporadic and localized snapshots, rather than comprehensive spatial and temporal coverage of the entire scene. Such prevalent data sparsity poses significant challenges to achieving accurate image localization. Our research is tailored to address this specific challenge, focusing on single image localization in environments where data is inherently sparse. We introduce a multi-scale convolutional attention network, incorporating feature-fused adversarial components, to effectively navigate the complexities of sparse data typical in civil engineering construction sites. The network employs large kernel convolutions for refined channel and spatial attention, ensuring precise location information transmission, even in data-limited scenarios. This accuracy is further augmented by multi-scale convolutional layers and a multi-level discriminator network, aiming to minimize the domain shift between virtual and real-world imagery. Our approach was rigorously tested and subjected to ablation studies on two public datasets, confirming its efficacy. In indoor settings, we achieved a median localization accuracy of 1.12 m and 9.80°, and in outdoor environments, our best results were 3.69 m and 1.67°. These outcomes highlight the effectiveness of our method in addressing the unique challenges posed by data sparsity in civil engineering construction. We also investigated the impact of domain adaptation on localization accuracy across different feature levels, finding that its effect varies depending on the degree of alignment between virtual and real datasets. In conclusion, this study offers a significant contribution to image localization in digital twin technology, particularly in the challenging context of data-sparse civil engineering construction processes. It paves the way for future research in optimizing image localization techniques in similar sparse data environments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3D model; Domain adaptation; Large kernel attention; Synthetic dataset; Visual localization","3D modeling; Image enhancement; Large datasets; 3D models; 3d-modeling; Civil engineering constructions; Data sparsity; Domain adaptation; Image localization; Large kernel attention; Single images; Synthetic datasets; Visual localization; Convolution","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200634854"

To bolster diverse applications and realize digital transformation, it is imperative to share the generated device data among multiple stakeholders involved in the digital twin system product life cycle. Since the device data contains sensitive and secret information, strict access control is required. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is commonly employed for the construction of a cryptographic-enforced data access control scheme. ABE enables data confidentiality and one-to-many fine-grained access control due to its flexibility and high scalability. Unfortunately, traditional ABE schemes adopted in digital twin system has been hindered by the single point of failure and trust problems. Blockchain is a secure distributed ledger technology with decentralization and tamper-proofing properties. In this article, we present a blockchain-empowered data access control scheme for digital twin system with attribute-based encryption. Firstly, blockchain is employed to construct a complete, tamper-resistant, and efficient architecture for digital twin system to address challenges of access control. Subsequently, to ensure the confidentiality of digital twin data, we employ ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-ABE) to achieve fine-grained and one-to-many access control. Finally, we combine blockchain-based architecture with the interplanetary file system (IPFS) to propose a data storage scheme to release storage pressure on the blockchain and improve system efficiency. Security analysis and performance evaluation exhibit that the proposed access control scheme can effectively protect the data security of digital twin system with efficient storage. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Access control; Attribute-based encryption; Blockchain; Digital twin; Interplanetary file system","Blockchain; Cloud storage; Computer architecture; Cryptography; File organization; Life cycle; Metadata; Sensitive data; Access control schemes; Attribute-based encryptions; Block-chain; Data access control; Device data; Digital transformation; Diverse applications; Filesystem; Fine grained; Interplanetary file system; Access control","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196708952"

Its model is the prerequisite for applying digital twins in workshops. Geometric model assembly is the primary concern in workshop-level digital twin modeling. However, current research lacks sufficient focus on the efficiency and application modes of equipment mesh model assembly features in geometric model assembly, hindering the construction of the workshop-level digital twin model. The equipment-level digital twin model typically only contains assembly information between individual parts and is generally represented by polygonal meshes; the lack of assembly information between equipment models impedes the assembly of the workshop-level digital twin model. To improve the efficiency of workshop-level digital twin modeling and the reusability of the original 3D assembly information, this paper proposes an assembly feature construction method of equipment mesh model for digital twin workshops. A 3D assembly information model is constructed to describe the information related to the equipment geometric model and the assembly features. Then, the assembly features of the equipment mesh model are gradually positioned preliminarily and precisely, achieving precise mapping of the assembly features in the 3D information model to the equipment mesh model and efficient construction of equipment mesh model assembly features. Finally, with the construction and application of equipment mesh model assembly features in an arc welding workshop and storage workshop as an example, the feasibility of the method in improving the modeling efficiency is verified through relevant comparative experiments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3D assembly information model; assembly feature; digital twin model; Digital twin workshop; equipment mesh model","3D modeling; Construction equipment; Efficiency; Electric arc welding; Information theory; Reusability; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3d assembly information model; Assembly features; Assembly information; Assembly information model; Digital twin model; Digital twin workshop; Equipment mesh model; Geometric models; Mesh modeling; Model assembly; Mesh generation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181458456"

However, often it is not clear whether a modelled configuration can be realised as a physical product. The combination of software- and hardware-artefacts harbours the risk of non-functioning products due to incompatible resource demands and provisionings of the components installed (realisability), thus can result in high financial loss for manufacturers. With new business models, such as over-the-air updates, they also face this risk for products already in the field, because it remains unclear whether a vehicle is still functioning after an update where resource demands have changed (update-ability). Manually analysing realisability and update-ability is infeasible in practice, as the number of product variants in a product line grows combinatorially (with respect to the number of configuration options). In this paper, we approach this challenge by proposing a novel baseline approach for the analysis of realisability and update-ability in automotive cyber-physical systems. We formally model resource demands and resource provisionings as well as the construction of a resource allocation problem per product variant based on constraint satisfaction problems. In the evaluation, we apply our method to an automotive case study by modelling realisation artefacts and investigate its feasibility and performance. Our results show that a non-realisable configuration of the product line can be identified in 206 ms median time.

It provides employment opportunities, generates income, and increases the export of agricultural products, particularly in rural areas. Sustainable farming practices promote soil health, biodiversity, and ecosystem services and are essential in many parts of the world. Farming is deeply rooted in cultures and traditions and is a way of life for many communities, passed down from generation to generation. Without farming, we would not have the abundance and variety of food that we enjoy today. Advancements in technology, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things, have greatly impacted agriculture by producing vast amounts of digital data on crops, soil, and weather conditions. However, managing and analyzing these data can be challenging for farmers, especially those in developing nations. To address this issue, affordable digital farming solutions, including open-source software platforms, sensor networks, and mobile apps, are being developed to help farmers optimize their resources, increase yields, and profits. Digital twin technology can play a crucial role in digital farming by providing farmers with a virtual replica of their physical farm. It is a digital depiction of a real-world asset, such a farm or a particular crop field, that gathers information from sensors, weather stations, and satellite pictures. This technology has arisen that has been hailed as revolutionary in a number of fields, including manufacturing machines, construction, agriculture, healthcare, and the automotive and aerospace industries. However, the technology is still in its early stages in agriculture, and it can be challenging to handle the interactions between different farming-related digital twin components. Additionally, digital twinning can require significant investment in technology and infrastructure, which may be a barrier for small-scale farmers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","agriculture; artificial intelligence; digital twins; Internet of Things (IoT); product life cycle","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006487045"

DDS provides flexible configurations defined in the formal design specification for safety and security. However, DDS programs suffer from both semantic bugs violating design specifications and software implementation bugs. To discover bugs, network protocol fuzzers have focused on testing client-server models by mutating input packets. However, they are unsuitable for fuzzing DDS programs due to a lack of consideration of the DDS-specific features, such as the DDS-specific input spaces (e.g., dynamic network topology formation and QoS and DDS security configurations) and impacts of DDS-specific semantic bugs (e.g., incorrect topology construction).In this paper, we propose DDSFuzz, a fuzzing framework effective for DDS programs by leveraging the DDS-specific features. Specifically, we develop a DDS dynamic network configuration input generator integrated with a customized state-of-the-art packet input mutator. This configuration input generator produces inputs while considering DDS-specific input spaces, DDS topologies, and parameter configurations and dependencies. This scheme enables DDSFuzz to test code that can be executable in certain DDS network configurations. Furthermore, our differential-fuzzing-based bug detector uncovers DDS-specific semantic bugs, built upon DDS-specific APIs and listeners. We evaluate DDSFuzz with three major DDS programs: Fast DDS, Cyclone DDS, and OpenDDS. As a result, DDSFuzz found 20 bugs, and seven CVEs have been assigned. Furthermore, DDSFuzz shows an average of 6.44 times higher code coverage than that of existing fuzzers showing the effectiveness of DDS bug detection. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cyber-physical systems; data distribution service; differential fuzzing","Client server computer systems; Computer software selection and evaluation; Cybersecurity; Formal specification; Input output programs; Model checking; Program debugging; Trees (mathematics); Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Data distribution services; Design specification; Differential fuzzing; Distributed network protocols; Dynamic configuration; Input space; Service program; Specific semantics; Software testing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212407878"

This study aims to enhance the preventive preservation of rammed earth historical heritage through a comprehensive methodology combining continuous monitoring, architectural inspections, and data fusion. By integrating nondestructive testing techniques such as ultrasound, thermography, and ground-penetrating radar with operational modal analysis and modeling, the proposed approach allows for early detection and assessment of structural vulnerabilities. This methodology was applied to the Tower of Muhammad in the Alhambra of Granada, Spain, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying and quantifying damage and predicting structural health. Using multi-source data (documentation, inspections, nondestructive tests, and continuous monitoring), a finite element model was built, calibrated (achieving an avg. error in modal frequencies of 1.28% and a minimum modal assurance criterion value of 0.94), and used to develop a surrogate model able to predict the modal properties of the tower in 0.02 (Formula presented.), becoming compatible with continuous system identification. The presented results highlight the importance of continuous data acquisition and advanced diagnostic tools for safeguarding rammed earth structures against environmental and anthropogenic threats.

As such, there has been a heightened demand for the creation of DT models. Nevertheless, manual operations continue to play a significant role in the construction process, irrespective of time and financial considerations. Hence, it is imperative to develop an approach for the rapid construction of DT shopfloors aimed at reducing the reliance on manual operations. To this end, a point cloud based expeditious construction framework for DT shopfloors was proposed in the present study, which comprises pre-processing, processing, and post-processing modules. The pre-processing module is responsible for providing a clear point cloud to the processing module, and the post-processing module will reuse a historical DT model directly or establish a new one manually according to the result from the processing module. To achieve the task of determining whether a reusable model exists and which model to reuse for the post-processing module based on the input clear point cloud, the Transfer Point Cloud Net (TPCN) is employed as the processing network, comprising multiple enhanced Transformer blocks. Additionally, it demonstrates the capability to transfer knowledge derived from publicly available datasets, thereby diminishing the need for reliance on proprietary industrial data for training purposes. Moreover, this capacity can reduce the number of parameters necessary for training TPCN, leading to substantial time and computational resource savings. Comparative experiments were also conducted to validate the performance of the TPCN. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Digital Twin Models; Point Cloud; Transformer","E-learning; Learning systems; Cloud-based; Deep learning; Digital twin model; Manual operations; Point-clouds; Post-processing; Pre-processing; Processing modules; Shopfloors; Transformer","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200903802"

However, the fragmented nature of the extensive International Organization for Standardization (ISO) guidelines for carbon assessment and the complexity of DT systems, hinder practitioners’ efforts to fully realize DT's potential in achieving the 2050 zero-emission target for operating buildings. This is evident in the continuous increase in operational carbon emissions from buildings, which reached an all-time high of 10 gigatonnes (GtCO<inf>2</inf>) in 2022, and the mere 13 % global adoption rate of DT in building retrofitting. The aim of this review study is to develop a DT-driven Decarbonization Framework for Operating Buildings (DT-DeFOB) – a pathway for cohesive implementation of complex DT systems for DOBs. Using the inclusion and exclusion method, 243 relevant studies from 2018 to 2023 were selected for scientometrics mapping and systematic literature review (SLR). Furthermore, 20 ISO guidelines were selected for comprehensive document analysis. The findings indicated a growing trajectory in DT literature; however, a limited definitive trend in its effectiveness for DOB was evident. The SLR highlighted a lack of dynamic carbon criteria tailored for operating buildings, as well as a notable absence of a cohesive pathway for implementing multifaceted DT systems in DOBs.

Still, the sequential nature of off-site production, encompassing casting, curing, and storage of the precast elements, is subject to significant uncertainties, including supply chain variability and environmental factors affecting curing times. Dynamic adjustments to the production schedule are essential for aligning with real-time changes, necessitating a robust framework for real-time data acquisition and analysis. Dynamic Scheduling (DS) is a responsive and adaptive approach that accommodates real-time changes, optimizes the production flow, and minimizes downtime or delays. However, the DS approach demands real-time data to quickly and efficiently respond to unforeseen challenges, which requires acquiring and analyzing production-relevant data throughout the production process. The Digital Twin (DT) emerges in Industry 4.0 (I4.0) as a bridge between physical operations and digital capabilities, enabling a seamless flow of information, for which the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) is a reference implementation. This study introduces a DS framework to optimize precast element production, utilizing a DT for real-time data aggregation across the production system. The framework implements a Semantic DT based on the AAS and the Linked Data approach. It employs Resource Description Framework (RDF) serialization of the AAS and an ontological representation of the production system for data integration. The framework leverages a simulation-based scheduler, which exchanges data with the DT in a Service-oriented Architecture (SoA) using SPARQL, a language for querying and updating graph databases. The approach is evaluated through a proof of concept, demonstrating effective uncertainty management in a dynamic production environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamic Scheduling; Industry 4.0; Linked Data; Modular construction; Precast concrete; Semantic digital twin","Curing; Data acquisition; Data integration; Digital storage; Industry 4.0; Precast concrete; Production control; Quality control; Semantics; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Supply chains; Sustainable development; Concrete elements; Dynamic scheduling; Linked datum; Precast elements; Production environments; Production system; Project efficiency; Real-time changes; Real-time data; Semantic digital twin; Modular construction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198289575"

Over-and-under-excavation assessment is typically time-consuming as it is undertaken manually and is prone to inaccuracies that adversely impact quality, safety, and costs. To overcome this problem, a status digital twin (to monitor physical conditions) is developed to assess over-and-under excavation during tunneling, enabling a robust and automated assessment of volumes of earth to be determined. The development of the status digital twin comprises three stages: (1) creating an as-designed building information model and as-built point cloud model; (2) producing an automated status update with newly added data; and (3) calculating the of over-and-under excavation volume by building a Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN). The status digital twin is tested in a large-scale tunnel project to evaluate its feasibility and effectiveness. The average over-and-under excavation thickness is 0.05 m, and the mean error of volume calculation is 4.54 %. The results demonstrate that the status digital twin can accurately assess over-and-under excavation during the construction of large-scale tunnel projects by providing instant feedback concerning over/under excavation, thus enabling quality to be effectively managed and costs to be controlled. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin; Over-and-under excavation; Point cloud; Triangulated irregular network","Tunneling (excavation); Tunnels; Large tunnels; Large-scales; Over-and-under excavation; Point-clouds; Quality costs; Quality safety; Structural safety; Triangulated irregular networks; Tunnel construction; Tunnel projects; Quality control","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196267513"

There is an ongoing need for the development of numerical methods that can accurately estimate SSI parameters to model these systems. In this paper, a Frequency Response Function (FRF)-based model updating method is developed that can estimate the embedded length of foundation piles, in addition to the mobilized soil mass and stiffness, when a lateral impact load is applied. Knowledge of the embedded length of piles is very important for modelling foundation behaviour, and may not be readily available from as-built construction information. For example, if developing reference damage models or digital twins of foundation structures, full knowledge of the pile geometry is required. The work in this paper develops a two-stage iterative model updating method, which utilizes FRF data obtained at the pile's head as a result of an applied lateral impact load. The method uses information from the 1st mode of vibration to estimate the mobilised soil mass and stiffness, and subsequently uses information from the 2nd mode of vibration to estimate the embedded length. To appraise the approach, impact tests are numerically simulated on a number of ‘piles’ (numerical spring-beam systems) with varying length/diameter (L/D) ratios to derive FRFs, whereby the models have known length and dynamic properties. These FRFs are then used as targets in the model updating approach, which iteratively varies the properties of a numerical model of a pile to obtain a match in the FRF data, and subsequently estimates the mobilised stiffness, mass, and embedded length. The results of the analyses illustrate that by minimising the difference in the first and second FRF peaks between the target and estimated FRFs, the method can accurately estimate the mass, stiffness and embedded length properties of the test ‘piles’. The performance of the approach against numerical case applications is assessed in this paper, as the properties of these systems are known in advance, facilitating quantification of the errors and performance. The developed method requires further validation through full-scale testing to confirm its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamics; Model-Updating; Parameter Estimation; Soil Stiffness; Soil-Structure Interaction; Winkler","Earthquake engineering; Frequency response; Iterative methods; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Piles; Soil testing; Soils; Stiffness; Structural dynamics; Structural health monitoring; Foundation piles; Frequency response functions; Function-based modeling; Model updating; Parameters estimation; Property; Soil stiffness; Soil-structure interaction; Updating methods; Winkler; Soil structure interactions","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195421431"

Leveraging a Building Information Model (BIM) offers a natural and promising approach to driving robotic construction workflows. However, because of uncertainties inherent in construction sites, such as discrepancies between the as-designed and as-built components, robots cannot solely rely on a BIM to plan and perform field construction work. Human workers are adept at improvising alternative plans with their creativity and experience and thus can assist robots in overcoming uncertainties and performing construction work successfully. In such scenarios, it is critical to continuously update the BIM as work processes unfold so that it includes as-built information for the ensuing construction and maintenance tasks. This research introduces an interactive closed-loop digital twin framework that integrates a BIM into human-robot collaborative construction workflows. The robot's functions are primarily driven by the BIM, but it adaptively adjusts its plans based on actual site conditions, while the human co-worker oversees and supervises the process. When necessary, the human co-worker intervenes in the robot's plan by changing the task sequence or workspace geometry or requesting a new motion plan to help the robot overcome the encountered uncertainties. A drywall installation case study is conducted to verify the proposed workflow. In addition, experiments are carried out to evaluate the system performance using an industrial robotic arm in a research laboratory setting that mimics a construction site and in the Gazebo simulation. Integrating the flexibility of human workers and the autonomy and accuracy afforded by the BIM, the proposed framework offers significant promise of increasing the robustness of construction robots in the performance of field construction work. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Building Information Model; Construction robotics; Digital twin; Human-robot collaboration","Architectural design; Collaborative robots; Construction; Industrial research; Information theory; Building Information Modelling; Closed-loop; Collaborative construction; Construction robotics; Construction workflow; Construction works; Human robots; Human-robot collaboration; Uncertainty; Workers'; Research laboratories","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195177361"

Yet, in the practical implementation of Digital Twin projects, several issues persist: ① How to formulate reasonable task objectives and action plans before project implementation? ② how to determine and assess the development level of the digital twin during project implementation? ③ How to evaluate the effectiveness of digital twin after project completion and how to enhance improvement in the next steps? Consequently, a methodological model is urgently needed to evaluate the development process of Digital Twins, offering a benchmark for their design, development, and appraisal. To address these issues, this paper introduces a five-level Digital Twin Maturity Model (DTMM), which systematically aligns DT capabilities, phased objectives, and technical requirements within a unified framework, creating a theoretical system capable of assessing DT's developmental level and specifying its construction trajectory. Further, this paper catalogs supporting tools aligned with the technical specifications stipulated in DTMM's functional capabilities, aiding developers in devising implementation strategies. Additionally, it scrutinizes the application status across six DT vertical sectors, conducts maturity evaluations, and confirms the efficacy of the proposed model. The conclusion can be drawn that DT is still in its embryonic phase.

To solve the problematic control of production tempo and process sequence optimization in the welding process, it is urgent to combine the characteristics of the digital twin for dynamic simulation and optimization. Therefore, the capacity evaluation and scheduling optimization for the ship welding production line (WPL) based on the digital twin is proposed. Firstly, to describe the construction method of the digital twin model and digital twin data, a strategy is proposed for the construction of a digital twin ship component WPL model. Based on the fusion mapping of model and data, the construction of the digital twin model for WPL (DTM-WPL) is achieved. Secondly, by using equipment failure rate, processing time and buffer capacity as evaluation indicators, an WPL optimization model based on digital twins is constructed to solve the WPL production sequencing problem. Thirdly, to illustrate the welding quality traceability and prediction process, a DTM-WPL synchronous mapping for quality prediction and adjustment method is proposed. Finally, taking small and medium-sized WPL as the research object, the capacity evaluation and scheduling optimization system of ship components is developed to evaluate the production capacity of ship components.

The digital twin, an advanced digital technology, empowers the construction sector to advance towards intelligent construction and digital transformation. It ultimately aims for highly accurate digital simulation to achieve comprehensive optimization of all phases of a construction project. Currently, the process of digital twin applications is facing challenges such as poor data quality, the inability to harmonize types that are difficult to integrate, and insufficient data security. Further research on the application of digital twins in the construction domain is still needed to accelerate the development of digital twins and promote their practical application. This paper analyzes the commonly used architectures for digital twins in the construction domain in the literature and summarizes the commonly used technologies to implement the architectures, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, data mining, cyber–physical systems, internet of things, virtual reality, augmented reality applications, and considers their advantages and limitations. The focus of this paper is centered on the application of digital twins in the entire lifecycle of a construction project, which includes the design, construction, operation, maintenance, demolition and restoration phases. Digital twins are mainly moving towards the integration of data and information, model automation, intelligent system control, and data security and privacy. Digital twins present data management and integration challenges, privacy and security protection, technical manpower development, and transformation needs. Future research should address these challenges by improving data quality, developing robust integration methodologies, and strengthening data security measures. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AEC; BIM; construction industry; construction project lifecycle; digital twin","Data privacy; Demolition; Information management; Project management; AEC; Construction fields; Construction project lifecycle; Construction projects; Construction sectors; Data quality; Digital technologies; Digital transformation; Intelligent constructions; Project lifecycle","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205262099"

The framework contains two steps. Firstly, based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and digital twin (DT) technology, a hypersonic flight vehicle digital twin (HFVDT) model is constructed. This HFVDT model can represent the real model and the parameter changes in HFV in real-time, and can update itself by the designed updating law through the flight data acquired by IoT. Then, the model changes caused by a fault can be fed back in real-time. Based on the real-time model, a model predictive static programming (MPSP) based controller design method is proposed to solve the online fault-tolerant control problem of HFV. MPSP provides a feasible online solution to optimal control problems with constraints. By converting the nonlinear optimal control problem to a static optimization the problem, the quantity of computation is greatly reduced, and then the optimal can be solved online. By the HFVDT and MPSP framework, the model change can be monitored and then an optimal controller can be constructed in real time. In this case, the fault-tolerant control problem of HFV can solved and the tracking performance is guaranteed. Finally, the novel framework is carried out on a numeral simulation to show its effectiveness. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital twin; fault-tolerant control; hypersonic flight vehicles; model predictive static programming","Flight simulators; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Nonlinear programming; Optimal control systems; Predictive control systems; Control problems; Faults tolerant controls; Hypersonic flight vehicles; Model change; Model construction; Model predictive; Model predictive static programming; Real models; Real- time; Static programming; Hypersonic vehicles","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205045578"

This risk can be minimized if we use models describing the structure, geometry, processes, interaction, and risk assessment as well as the data collected over the lifetime of a civil structure. They are considered as a unity together with the civil structure. These model-based systems constitute a digital twin of such a civil structure, which through appropriate operative services remain in permanent use and thus co-evolve with the civil structure even over a long-lasting lifetime. Even though research on digital twins for civil structures has grown over the last few years, digital twin engineering with heterogeneous models and data sources is still challenging. Within this article, we describe models used within all phases of the whole civil structure life cycle. We identify the models from the computer science, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, and business management domains as specifically relevant for this purpose, as they seem to cover all relevant aspects of sustainable civil structures at best, and discuss them using a dam as an example. Moreover, we discuss challenges for creating and using models within different scenarios such as improving the sustainability of civil structures, evaluating risks, engineering digital twins, parallel software and object evolution, and changing technologies and software stacks. We show how this holistic view from different perspectives helps overcome challenges and raises new ones. The consideration from these different perspectives enables the long-term software support of civil structures while simultaneously opening up new paths and needs for research on the digitalization of long-lasting structures. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BIM; Civil structures; Digital twin; Engineering; Geometric models; GIM; Intelligent civil infrastructural systems; Internet of Things; Interoperability; Life cycle; Model-based software engineering; Modeling smart material; Operations management","Architectural design; Interoperability; Life cycle; Risk assessment; Risk perception; BIM; Civil structure; Geometric models; GIM; Integrating model; Intelligent civil infrastructural system; Long lasting; Model-based software engineering; Modeling smart material; Operation management; Internet of things","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199520561"

The strategy involves the extraction of coordinates of key cable regions through the characterization of cable geometry and local registration methods, followed by the computation of cable forces and shapes using segmented catenary theory and nonlinear optimization. The approach is validated with a single-curvature cable-net structure, with the accuracy of cable shapes within ±5 mm and errors in cable forces <5%.

Among the state-of-the-art approaches in the maintenance industry, predictive maintenance (PdM) is a prominent approach by anticipating unexpected failures and unscheduled maintenance tasks. However, most current PdM frameworks are facility-specific, lacking generality and scalability. Besides, existing solutions mainly concentrate on condition monitoring and fault identification rather than failure prediction. Moreover, good prediction results rely heavily on sufficient labelled data sets, which are costly and labour-intensive to collect. To address these issues, the author developed a unified PdM framework for the building industry from the DT perspective. Next, a novel failure prediction method utilising the Semi-supervised Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has been proposed in this article, which makes effective utilisation of both labelled and unlabelled data. Finally, an online platform has been developed to present the monitoring and prediction information.

These features pose significant challenges to planning, scheduling, and execution (PSE) of fit-out activities due to operational parallelism, distributional diversity, and narrower constrained time window in modular construction. Hence, logistics-operation and multi-operations synchronizations in a real-time manner are crucial for PSE of modular construction fit-out management. With the support of cutting-edge information technologies, the real-time data inside the generated digital twins can simplify online optimization models and convert stochastic factors into deterministic parameters.

This research addresses this issue by investigating CE strategies aimed at minimising C&D waste in Australian construction projects (CPs). Utilising a qualitative approach, the study is based on 20 interviews and four case studies of commercial CPs, analysed through NVivo content analysis. The findings emphasise the need to integrate CE strategies at every CP stage. In the pre-design phase, setting sustainable objectives and engaging stakeholders early is crucial for aligning goals to reduce C&D waste. The tendering process benefits from incorporating WM into contracts, demonstrating early commitment to sustainability. The design phase, through Building Information Modelling and designing for disassembly, offers substantial waste-reduction opportunities. Modular and prefabricated components during the construction phase enhance material reuse and recycling. Operational strategies like regular maintenance and retrofitting extend material lifespan, while selective demolition and digital cataloguing at the end-of-life phase enable efficient material recovery. This highlights the essential roles of policy, technology, and stakeholder collaboration in advancing CE practices, providing practical insights for construction professionals and policymakers to implement CE-related strategies in CPs.

Finally, the formal modeling of the adaptive adjustment capability enables the construction of the knowledge model that drives the adaptive digital twin. In adaptive digital twin, the virtual and real mapping of process information facilitates the knowledge model to continuously update the domain knowledge, which enables the adaptive decision-making ability to dynamically adapt to different processing requirements in the physical model. As a fusion technique developed in intelligent production lines, the modeling of adaptive digital twin has been well applied and validated in commutator finishing lines. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive decision-making; Adaptive digital twin; Formal modeling; Knowledge model; Process information digital model","Domain Knowledge; Mapping; Adaptive adjustment; Adaptive decision making; Adaptive digital twin; Digital modeling; Formal modeling; Knowledge model; Multi-varieties; Process information; Process information digital model; Production line; Decision making","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196505159"

However, aging bridges often require renovation or reconstruction. Promising approaches for enhancing asset management and cost reduction are digital twins and predictive maintenance strategies. However, the creation of geometric-semantic as-is models as a basis for digital twins currently involves labor-intensive manual data capture and modeling. Modern deep learning models, such as Kernel Point Convolution (KPConv) show promising results in reducing the time needed to create digital twins by semantically segmenting point cloud data but have so far been hindered by the lack of a reliable quality measure, which can predict when the model's prediction can be trusted. This is especially viable in the construction industry, where objects and sensors may vary widely between projects and contractors. In this work, we present Bayesian neural networks, implemented through Variational Inference and Monte-Carlo dropout as approaches to conducting inference with KPConv, which show improvements in the confidence estimation and out-of-domain (OOD) detection in the scans of typical infrastructure point clouds. When confronted with different domain shifts to the test data, such as a change of scanning device and introduction of unseen classes the proposed model showed a 25.3% decrease in expected calibration error (ECE) and a 4.82 increase in OOD detection in terms of outlier-intersection-over-union (O-IoU) on average with respect to a deterministic baseline. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayesian deep learning; BIM; Bridge; Digital twin; Point cloud; Semantic segmentation; Uncertainty estimation","Bayesian networks; Construction industry; Cost reduction; Deep learning; E-learning; Neural networks; Semantic Segmentation; Statistical tests; Bayesian; Bayesian deep learning; BIM; Domain detections; Infrastructure project; Point cloud segmentation; Point-clouds; Semantic segmentation; Uncertainty; Uncertainty estimation; Semantics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192261734"

Achieving the accurate prediction of assembly accuracy for these complex products before assembling is the premise of improving the assembly quality and performance, and also has always been a challenge. Existing assembly accuracy prediction methods focus on acquiring the assembly deviation based on CAD model and manufacturing errors of parts, but rarely involve the multidimensional error coupling of parts and the influencing factors in the assembly process, which inevitably cause a certain gap between the prediction result and the actual condition, affecting the reliability of the prediction result. To address the above problems, this paper presents a digital twin (DT)-driven assembly accuracy prediction method for the HPPA of complex products. Firstly, this paper introduces the methodology overview and proposes an overall framework for DT-driven assembly accuracy prediction. Secondly, three key enabling technologies realizing the DT-driven assembly accuracy prediction, including the construction of part digital twin model, the generation of DT-based assembly process model, and assembly deviation propagation and accuracy analysis are introduced in detail.

The current research was mainly focused on digital twin based on design models representing ideal geometric features and behaviors at macroscopic scales, which is challenging to accurately represent accuracy and performance. However, a numerical representation is essential for precision microstructures whose accuracy and performance are difficult to measure. The concept of a digital twin for an accurate representation, proposed in 2015, is still in the conceptual stage without a clear construction method. Therefore, the goal of accurate representation has not been achieved. This paper defines the concept and connotation of an accuracy and performance-oriented accurate digital twin model and establishes its architecture in two levels: geometric and physical. First, a geometric digital twin model is constructed by the contact surfaces distributed error modeling and virtual assembly with nonuniform contact states. Then, based on this, a physical digital twin model is constructed by considering the linear and nonlinear response of the structural internal physical properties to the external environment and time to characterize the accuracy and performance variation. Finally, the models are evaluated. The method is validated on microtarget assembly. The estimated values of surface modeling, center offset, and stress prediction accuracy are 94.22%, 89.3%, and 83.27%. This paper provides a modeling methodology for the digital twin research to accurately represent accuracy and performance, which is critical for product quality improvements in intelligent manufacturing.

However, drive-by SHM is generally known as a short-term monitoring technique due to the challenges associated with using multiple passages of instrumented vehicles for a long time. This paper proposes combining the potentiality of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) into drive-by damage detection by introducing In-Fleet SHM. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that proposes using CAVs for SHM application in civil engineering structures. Each In-Fleet CAV could automatically collect the vehicle's persistent and temporal data by the embedded sensors and transmit them to edge computing systems for analysis. These persistent data include type and model and temporal parameters encompassing position, speed, heading, and vertical acceleration of CAVs. Knowing the persistent and temporal data of the passing vehicles over the transportation infrastructures enables the identification of the dynamic parameters of the bridge from the vehicles’ vertical acceleration response using drive-by techniques and, on the other hand, reconstruction of the finite element model of the passing vehicles over the supporting bridges in a near real-time manner. In contrast to the drive-by SHM, In-Fleet monitoring has an expanded spatial and temporal coverage, enabling continuous near real-time monitoring of highway bridges of the transportation network. The accuracy and resolution of the identified modal components in In-Fleet SHM are enhanced due to the crowdsensing nature of the collected data. Furthermore, by offering a unique set of characteristics, this method fills the crucial gap in implementing Industry 4.0 technologies and digital twins for SHM of bridges. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Autonomous vehicles; Damage detection; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Fleet operations; Autonomous Vehicles; Cost-efficient; Instrumented vehicle; Medium size; Monitoring techniques; Multiple passage; NO sensor; Short-term monitoring; Temporal Data; Vertical accelerations; Structural health monitoring; bridge; damage; health monitoring; road construction; sensor; structural analysis; transportation infrastructure","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187453907"

The concept of a digital twin—a model of the physical environment that has a real-time two-way link between the physical and the digital, with the virtual model changing over time to reflect changes in the real world—lends itself well to the continually changing environment of a construction project. Predictive capabilities built into a twin also have great potential for construction planning—including in supply chain management and waste disposal as well as in the construction process itself. Underpinning this opportunity is location data, which model where something is happening and when and can be used to solve a wide range of problems. In particular, location (the power of where) can integrate diverse data sources and types into a single system, overcoming interoperability challenges that are known to be a barrier to twin implementation. This paper demonstrates the power of location-enabled digital twins in the context of a highway construction project, documenting and addressing data engineering tasks and functionality development to explore the potential of digital twins in the context of two case studies—health and safety and construction monitoring. We develop two demonstrators using data from an existing construction project (building on data and requirements from industry partner Skanska) to build twins that make use of the powers of 4D data presentation offered by the Unreal Gaming Engine and CesiumJS mapping, while software development expertise is sometimes available to construction firms, we specifically explore to what extent the no-code approach available within Unreal can be deployed in this context. Our findings provide evidence to construction companies as to the benefits of digital twins, as well as an understanding of the data engineering and technical skills required to achieve these benefits. The overall results demonstrate the potential for digital twins to unlock and democratise construction data, taking them beyond the niche use of experts and into the boardroom. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","construction; data integration; digital twins; gaming engine; Unreal Engine","Construction; Construction equipment; Construction industry; Data integration; Highway engineering; Interoperability; Location; Project management; Software design; Supply chain management; Waste disposal; Construction projects; Data engineering; Gaming engines; Health and safety; Physical environments; Power; Real- time; Two ways; Unreal engine; Urban environments; Engines","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199669180"

The adoption of Building Digital Twins (BDT) in the construction site is a promising solution to this issue, by automating data acquisition and knowledge extraction processes and providing what-if scenario simulation capabilities. Furthermore, the current research sets the principles to define, replicate, and scale-up the architecture of a Building Digital Twin Platform (BDTP), conceived as a scalar ecosystem, which allows to seamlessly manage on-site construction processes, integrating cross-cutting domains for the construction site optimization (Progress monitoring, Quality control, Operational Health and Safety, Equipment control, and Production planning). The starting point of the research is a comprehensive diagnosis of on-site process inefficiencies and the barriers to its digitalization leading to the user requirements, which have been underpinned by questionnaires and interviews addressed within an open innovation user-centered approach around Living Labs. The research has been conceived following the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology and based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) analysis for the continuous improvement of the construction process. By means of the adoption of the standard Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), based on the BDTP architecture, the research has resulted in BPMN workflows stemmed from the Digital Twin (DT) where the DT itself is an actor in a service-oriented data-exchange workflow.

Delays can be caused by several project components; however, the issue is amplified when delays occur simultaneously. Classifying delays is relevant in order to allocate responsibility to the parties. In Italy, the delay in the delivery of medium and large-sized works in residential urban centers is about 15% compared to the project forecast. Moreover, the AECO sector’s ability to adapt to emerging challenges, such as environmental sustainability and digitization, is limited by the lack of innovation in management methods. The aim of this research is to create a methodology for managing the built and to-be-built environment in a digital way. This will optimize the building process by reducing delays and waste of resources. The methodology will use tools such as digital twin (DT), Building Information Modeling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms.

This digital twin provides an opportunity to utilize AR technology for real-time verification of on-site project information. Although many AR developments for construction sites have been attempted, they have been limited to accessing information on stationary components via Building Information Models. There have been no attempts to access information on dynamically changing resources, such as personnel and equipment. This paper addresses this gap by presenting an AR framework that enables site managers to verify real-time information on specific personnel or equipment. It introduces a matching algorithm for retrieving the necessary information from the digital twin. This algorithm is pivotal in identifying and retrieving the specific information needed from the vast dataset within the digital twin. The matching process integrates object detection and tracking algorithms applied to video frames from AR devices, along with GPS and IMU sensor data. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of this matching algorithm to streamline on-site management and reduce the effort required to interact with digital twin information.

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to review the information security issues that may occur in the distributed economic dispatch system and the defense measures. By summarizing the existing literature on information security issues and defense measures, it can be found that the current research focuses on the cyber-side defense for information security, and lacks consideration of the cyber-physical coupling characteristics. Additionally, the separate cyber-side defense measures still have a defense blind spot and cannot respond in a timely manner to the physical-side actions caused by information security issues.

Applying digital twin technology to production lines is one of the most promising approaches. However, factory personnel are not all aware and familiar with digital twin technology, and they have difficulty adapting or implementing digital twin scenarios. To more easily construct or reconfigure production line digital twin scenarios, this paper proposes a graphics-based, modular, and user-oriented digital twin software framework for production lines. The framework divides the digital twin implementation process into five functional modules: twin model construction, model operation, connection and interaction, control logic, visualization assistance and interaction, which are graphically encapsulated. The modular format helps standardize the construction and operation of the digital twin production line, and improves the flexibility and versatility of the framework. Meanwhile, multiple functional libraries are encapsulated to simplify the construction steps and processes based on graphical user interface. Combining visual programming to implement control logic in a low-code visual programming manner, reducing the difficulty of getting started. And various UI elements are used to enhance human–computer interaction. A digital twin platform was developed based on the proposed framework, and experiments were conducted with a hardware production line as an example. The experimental results show that it is feasible to construct digital twin production lines conveniently and reduce the complexity of the constructing process based on this platform, thus the feasibility of the framework is verified. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin; Graphical User Interface (GUI); Modular approach; Smart manufacturing; Visual programming","Computer circuits; Computer programming; Human computer interaction; Batch sizes; Control logic; Graphical user interface; Modular approach; Modulars; Process-based; Production line; Smart manufacturing; Software frameworks; Visual programming; Graphical user interfaces","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196732061"

To address these challenges, an innovative framework has been developed using the Internet of Things (IoT) technology-based low-cost wireless sensors.

This framework allows remote real-time concrete compressive strength monitoring while reducing the need for on-site laboratory testing. This aspect can ultimately add digital competencies to the construction industry. The IoT-based data is further integrated with the Building Information Modeling (BIM) model of the structure, developing its Digital Twin (DT), which enables the concerned authorities to remotely access the concrete compressive strength parameters, particularly in the early stages. The proposed system presents notable advantages compared to traditional methods by enabling remote real-time monitoring of concrete strength parameters in the BIM environment and facilitating informed decision-making to optimize the construction schedule utilizing the Active BIM system. It serves as a pioneering advancement in internet/remote applications designed to monitor early-age compressive strength.

In Basic Oxygen Steel (BOS) making process, metal is poured from Hot Metal (HM) ladles, utilising overhead gantry cranes, into furnaces for further processing. Due to the large quantities of liquid metal poured, this operation poses significant safety concerns associated with metal spillage and releases of heat emissions. This can further lead to damage being caused to surrounding infrastructure. Pouring automation can reduce the likelihood of metal spillage, optimising ladle movement for reduction in heat emission releases. Given the hazardous nature of this operation, robust testing and evaluation of automated crane pouring movements is required prior to their application. A digital twin (DT) model of an overhead gantry crane/HM ladle system is presented here, intended to provide a safe testing environment for controlled pouring movement and serve as a testbed for control system design studies. Accurate crane movement is achieved using multi-body dynamics, solving for non-linearities present due to rigid joint frictional components. The flow rate of HM is estimated through the application of a dynamic model, allowing the modelling of system dynamics due to differences in HM pouring weights. The devised DT model is evaluated by simulating real crane movement and making a comparison on the resultant changing HM weight inside the ladle. The devised DT removes the need for construction of a physical model or performing tests directly on the HM pouring system. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Basic oxygen steelmaking; Digital twin; Dynamic system; Flow estimation; Friction estimation; Hot metal pouring; Multi-body dynamics","Friction; Steelmaking; Basic oxygen steel makings; Flow estimation; Friction estimation; Heat emission; Hot metal; Hot metal pouring; Large-scales; Multibody dynamic (MBD); Safety concerns; Steelmaking process; Liquid metals","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192892507"

Thus, this study aims to look at the relationship between construction app acceptance and the digital qualities of construction professionals (CPs) to determine whether understanding the connection can assist predict construction app user behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: This study’s theoretical approach was derived from the European Union digital competence model, which supports the hypothesis that the traits associated with digital competence enable digitally competent CPs to embrace construction apps. Six hypotheses were developed to investigate the theories, and multiple linear regression analysis was used to predict the acceptance of construction apps based on the CP’s attributes. Findings: The investigation’s findings revealed that the CP’s attributes can explain at least 50% of the proportion of variance in 34 construction apps. The use of a smartphone (Mean Score = 3.30; Factor Loading = 0.609), technological orientation (Mean Score = 3.55; Factor Loading = 0.663), information technology skills (Mean Score = 3.48; Factor Loading = 0.649), information on construction innovation (Mean Score = 3.73; Factor Loading = 0.528) and interest in R&D (Mean Score = 3.48; Factor Loading = 0.531) are the digital characteristics that can essentially forecast the acceptance of construction apps. The data backs up the notion that CPs would gain digital competency before accepting construction apps. This is because a digitally savvy CP will most likely embrace construction apps.

The purpose of this paper is to solve the problem of the existing underground space monitoring technology not being centralized and unified. In view of the problems related to large underground spaces in the process of constructing complex structures, with the introduction of Internet of Things technology and digital twins, we put forward an application of an intelligent safety-monitoring digital twin system in the construction of a large underground space structure, and at the same time, explore the Internet and digital integration mechanism of the twin system. The twin system uses BIM technology to establish the corresponding physical construction model, and collects multi-source heterogeneous monitoring data in real time through Internet of Things technology to achieve the exchange of information between the virtual construction model and the physical construction model. The twin system uses the multi-source heterogeneous data for real-time security analysis, and obtains the security status of the structure and feeds it back to the application service layer. The effectiveness and practicability of the twin system in large underground spaces are verified by an example project. Aiming at the safe performance of the orthogonal arch, the mapping relationship of various parameter indexes is obtained, and reasonable control measures are given.

However, existing road infrastructure confronts challenges due to prolonged use and insufficient maintenance. Previous research on autonomous vehicle navigation has focused on determining the trajectory with the shortest distance, while neglecting road construction information, leading to potential time and energy inefficiencies in real-world scenarios involving infrastructure development. To address this issue, a digital twin-embedded multi-objective autonomous vehicle navigation is proposed under the condition of infrastructure construction. The authors propose an image processing algorithm that leverages captured images of the road construction environment to enable road extraction and modelling of the autonomous vehicle workspace. Additionally, a wavelet neural network is developed to predict real-time traffic flow, considering its inherent characteristics. Moreover, a multi-objective brainstorm optimisation (BSO)-based method for path planning is introduced, which optimises total time-cost and energy consumption objective functions. To ensure optimal trajectory planning during infrastructure construction, the algorithm incorporates a real-time updated digital twin throughout autonomous vehicle operations. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model are validated through simulation and comparative studies conducted in diverse scenarios involving road construction. The results highlight the improved performance and reliability of the autonomous vehicle system when equipped with the authors’ approach, demonstrating its potential for enhancing efficiency and minimising disruptions caused by road infrastructure development. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","autonomous vehicle; intelligent robots; motion planning; navigation; path planning; robot planning","Air navigation; Autonomous vehicles; Energy utilization; Highway planning; Image processing; Intelligent robots; Navigation systems; Roads and streets; Robot programming; Autonomous operations; Autonomous vehicle navigation; Autonomous Vehicles; Construction information; Infrastructure construction; Infrastructure development; Motion-planning; Multi objective; Road infrastructures; Robot planning; Motion planning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188323550"

In this article, we propose a new distributed and secure digital twin-driven IIoT framework that integrates federated learning and directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain with sharding. The proposed framework includes three planes: 1) the data plane; 2) the blockchain plane; and 3) the digital twin plane. Specifically, the data plane performs federated learning through a set of cluster heads to train models at network edges for twin model construction. The blockchain plane, which supports sharding, utilizes a hierarchical consensus scheme based on DAG blockchain to verify both local model updates and global model updates. The digital twin plane is responsible for constructing and maintaining twin model. Then, an efficient resource scheduling scheme is designed by considering performance of both federated learning and DAG blockchain with sharding. Accordingly, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize long-term utility of the digital twin-driven IIoT. To cope with mapping error in the digital twin plane, a multiagent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) approach is developed to solve the optimization problem. Numerical results illustrate that comparing with traditional approach, the proposed MAPPO improves utility by about 37 %, and reduces time latency by about 14%. Moreover, it also can well adapt to the mapping error. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin; directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain with sharding; federated learning; Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); multiagent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO); resource scheduling","Directed graphs; E-learning; Internet of things; Learning systems; Mapping; Multi agent systems; Optimization; Acyclic graphs; Adaptation models; Block-chain; Directed acyclic graph blockchain with sharding; Federated learning; Industrial internet of thing; Multi agent; Multi-agent proximal policy optimization; Policy optimization; Resource-scheduling; Sharding; Blockchain","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183961744"

Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative method was used for this research. Questionnaires were sent to various CPs in Southwestern part of Nigeria. A total of 150 questionnaires were sent out, while 135 were gotten back from the partakers. The data received from the partakers were computed by applying descriptive and exploratory factor analysis. Findings: In this study, conflict leads to the abandonment of the CPs’ task being rated highest by the participants. This was followed by conflict that results in insufficient communication, generates job pressure, results to frustrations and displeasure among the CPs, helps in early problem identification, causes work damage among professionals, helps in solving professional organization problems, improves productivity of professionals, improves communication among the professionals and so on. Research limitations/implications: This paper is limited to CPs that are members of professional bodies in Nigeria, and only 135 participants participated. Though, this paper suggests that a mixed-method approach should be utilized in further studies with a wider coverage. Practical implications: The findings from this paper will increase the understanding of CPs in Nigeria on various impacts of conflict on performance in the construction industry, most specifically the professional bodies. Moreover, this study will increase the knowledge of CPs to always avoid whatever that leads to the abandonment of their tasks. Additionally, this study will benefit the CPs to avoid insufficient communication among themselves, in order to accomplish great performance and efficiency in their respective professional bodies. Originality/value: Since previous studies on impacts of construction conflict in Nigeria were only focused on contractors and consultants in construction project, this current study filled the gap by evaluating the impacts of CPs’ conflict on performance in the NCI. Also, the method of analysis used for this study is exemptional because previous studies have overlooked the method. However, it is recommended that CPs must communicate more with others so as to ensure favorable conflict effects on performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conflict impacts; Construction industry; Construction performance; Construction professionals; Nigeria","Construction; Damage detection; Factor analysis; Professional aspects; Surveys; Conflict impact; Construction performance; Construction professionals; Design/methodology/approach; Factors analysis; Nigeria; Nigerians; Performance; Professional help; Quantitative method; Construction industry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122668555"

The main challenges to the evolution of DT practical applications are also analyzed. A combination of a literature review, multi-case study analysis, and comparative analysis compose the deployed methodology. Standardization and a maturity level classification are proposed to drive progress of the adoption of DTs. The distinct aspects of the different industries and their assets are evaluated to the conclusion that DTs are better employed for maintenance of structures within E&C. DTs have become a well-worn topic, but the abundance of complex theoretical frameworks is met with simple or inexistent practical applications.

These conventional methods are often costly, time-consuming, and labour-intensive, demanding manual intervention. To address these limitations, this study explores the potential of using digital twins as a promising solution to offer detailed insights, reducing the dependence on physical experiments for studying robot-built environment interactions.Although the concept of digital twins is popular in many domains, the use of digital twins for this specific problem has not been explored yet. A novel methodology for assessing existing built environment guidelines by incorporating them as an architectural digital twin asset within robot simulation software is proposed in this regard. By analysing the digital interactions between robots and the architectural digital twin assets in simulations, the compatibility of the environment with robots is evaluated, ultimately contributing to enhancing these guidelines to be robot-inclusive. The ultimate goal is to create environments that are not only inclusive but also readily accessible to Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs). With this objective, the proposed methodology is tested on robots of different specifications to understand the robots’ interactions with different architectural digital twin environments and obstacles. The digital twin effectively demonstrates the capability of the proposed approach in assessing the robots’ suitability for deployment in the simulated environments. The gained insights contribute to improved comprehension and strengthen the existing design guidelines. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","accessibility standards; built environment; design guidelines; digital twin; robot inclusivity; robot-accessible design","Computer software; Machine design; Regulatory compliance; Accessibility standard; Built environment; Conventional methods; Design guideline; Labour-intensive; Manual intervention; Physical experiments; Robot inclusivity; Robot interactions; Robot-accessible design; Robots","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194457340"

While the digital representation (DT) of physical objects, end users, and edge computing systems is crucial in the Metaverse, the construction of these DTs and the interplay between them have not been well-investigated. In this article, we discuss the bidirectional reliance between the DT and the MEC system and investigate the creation of DTs of objects and users on the MEC servers and DT-assisted edge computing (DTEC). To ensure seamless handover among MEC servers and to avoid intermittent Metaverse services, we also explore the interaction between local DTECs on local MEC servers and the global DTEC on the cloud server due to the dynamic nature of network states (e.g., channel state and users' mobility).

DTs, representing virtual replicas of physical objects, products or processes established thanks to a bidirectional continuous flow of information between the physical and the virtual world, are currently adopted in multiple domains such as manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, energy, construction, smart cities and smart mobility, etc. DTs live together with the physical system they replicate, receiving the same data and often triggering specific control actions that directly impact on the real system status. When dealing with DTs of complex Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), the data sources may be heterogeneous and untrustworthy, which requires the DT to be able to address security issues related to data in transit from/to the physical twin and data at rest. A possible way to address these data security issues consists in adopting Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) which provide several security guarantees on data through cryptographic hashing techniques. In this work, we present a three-fold contribution: (i) we discuss the results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the state-of-the-art of the research related to the integration between DLT and Digital Twins, aimed at clarifying relevant aspects such as, among others, what is the favourite DLT choice in existing proposals or what is the type of DT-related information to store on-chain; (ii) leveraging the SLR results and other related research, we propose an architectural framework for the integration of DT and DLTs (more specifically, blockchains); (iii) we validate the proposed architecture by means of two proof-of-concept implementations leveraging different technological stacks and taking into account two different operational scenarios. Finally, we conduct a requirements coverage analysis and compare the PoCs through a coverage matrix. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Data security; Data trustworthiness; Digital Twins; Distributed Ledger Technologies; Reference architecture","Cyber Physical System; Cybersecurity; Distributed ledger; Embedded systems; Network security; Virtual reality; Block-chain; Continuous-flow; Data trustworthiness; Distributed ledg technology; Physical objects; Physical process; Physical products; Reference architecture; Security issues; Systematic literature review; Blockchain","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186518800"

The case study is the construction of an office building in which independent information pipelines can track different aspects of the construction process and the aggregate result can assist managers in decision making in the form of a vaster entity: its digital twin. The digital twin prototype is designed as a recipient of information that mirror its physical building and its systems. The paper contributes with a real case in which these pipelines enable continuous monitoring and analysis of various basic parameters during construction. With a varied array of sensors installed, data was collected, organized and transmitted through a knowledge graph-based system to the digital twin dashboard. A dashboard is able to allocate many sources of data (from sensors, images or point clouds) but also, it helps visualizing data analysis that could help making informed decisions about the building during construction. The paper emphasizes the varied nature of data in construction sites as well as the importance of proper data channeling to enable multi-purpose, effective decision-making using the digital twin. Overall, the paper provides a real life insight that challenges massive implementation of digital twins within the existing construction sites for an office building. It also highlights its potential to improve productivity, resource efficiency, health and safety in construction environments.

Moreover, weak communication links between these devices may hinder the potential of digital twins. To address these issues, we propose a two-layer digital twin edge network, in which the physical network layer offloads training tasks using passive reflecting links, and the digital twin layer establishes a digital twin model to record the dynamic states of physical components. We then formulate a system cost minimization problem to jointly optimize task offloading, configurations of passive reflecting links, and computing resources. Finally, we design a federated deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheme to solve the problem, where local agents train offloading decisions and global agents optimize the allocation of edge computing resources and configurations of passive reflecting elements.

The success of most current methods relies on the assumption that sufficient high-quality labeled datasets can be obtained for model training. However, in real-world industrial scenarios, obtaining such datasets is difficult or nearly impossible, thereby hindering the practical implementation of these methods. The integration of virtual modeling and transfer learning offers a powerful approach to meet the above challenge. Abundant virtual data of different fault categories can be acquired in the virtual space with highly flexible and at a low cost, and transfer learning can enhance the practical utility of these virtual data for contributing to the construction of diagnosis models. Therefore, this paper proposes a digital twin-driven partial domain fault diagnosis method based on unlabeled physical data and labeled virtual data. First, a virtual model of rotating machinery is built to generate labeled virtual fault data with enough fault types. Then, an adversarial transfer learning network is developed to leverage the effective knowledge from the virtual and physical data. Meanwhile, a weighting learning module is introduced to reduce the negative effect caused by the redundant fault categories in the virtual space. Finally, the proposed digital twin-driven transfer learning network is trained with the labeled virtual data and unlabeled physical data. Experiments on a light truck transmission system demonstrate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory diagnostic performance even without labeled physical fault data, contributing to the advancement of AI engineering applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adversarial transfer learning network; Digital twin; Fault diagnosis; Rotating machinery; Virtual model","E-learning; Fault detection; Knowledge management; Learning systems; Light transmission; Rotating machinery; Adversarial transfer learning network; Fault data; Fault diagnosis method; Faults diagnosis; Learning network; Physical data; Transfer learning; Virtual data; Virtual models; Virtual spaces; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182030362"

Additionally, an RBF surrogate model for tulip contacts is built based on multiple sets of dimensionality reduction data.

This fusion process aims to obtain the state indices and level that accurately characterize the operating status of the contact, enabling fault diagnosis. Finally, to collect the status information of tulip contact, a data acquisition system is employed. By combining the Surrogate model and fault evaluation algorithm, three-dimensional field cloud image rendering and fault diagnosis of contacts are carried out to realize the online simulation of virtual contact model and the construction of digital twin system. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for the condition monitoring and maintenance of tulip contact in high-voltage switchgear. They can serve as a useful reference for ensuring the safe and efficient operation of power equipment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","contact temperature rise; digital twin; fault diagnosis; proxy model; switchgear","Computer software; Condition monitoring; Data acquisition; Electric power systems; Fault detection; Fuzzy neural networks; Nearest neighbor search; Pattern recognition; Three dimensional computer graphics; Time domain analysis; Contact temperature; Contact temperature rise; Electrical performance; Fault diagnosis method; Faults diagnosis; High voltage switchgear; Power equipment; Proxy model; Surrogate modeling; Temperature rise; Failure analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197312184"

However, there has been some misconception about how DT differs from BIM. As a result, industry professionals reject DT even in BIM-based construction projects due to reluctance to innovate. Furthermore, researchers have repeatedly developed tools and techniques with the same goals using DT and BIM to assist practitioners in construction projects. Therefore, this study aims to assist industry professionals and researchers in understanding the relationship between DT and BIM and synthesize existing works on DT and BIM. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review was conducted on published articles related to DT and BIM. A total record of 54 journal articles were identified and analyzed. Findings: The analysis of the selected journal articles revealed four types of relationships between DT and BIM: BIM is a subset of DT, DT is a subset of BIM, BIM is DT, and no relationship between BIM and DT. The existing research on DT and BIM in construction projects targets improvements in five areas: planning, design, construction, operations and maintenance, and decommissioning. In addition, several areas have emerged, such as developing geo-referencing approaches for infrastructure projects, applying the proposed methodology to other construction geometries and creating 3D visualization using color schemes. Originality/value: This study contributed to the existing body of knowledge by overviewing existing research related to DT and BIM in construction projects.

Recent advances in sensors, data fusion techniques, and artificial intelligence have enabled integrated digital technologies (e.g., digital twins) as a promising trend to achieve emission reduction and net-zero. While digital twins in the construction sector have shown rapid growth in recent years, most applications focus on the improvement of productivity, safety and management. There is a lack of critical review and discussion of state-of-the-art digital twins to improve sustainability in this sector, particularly in reducing carbon emissions. This paper reviews the existing research where digital twins have been directly used to enhance sustainability throughout the entire life cycle of a building (including design, construction, operation and maintenance, renovation, and demolition). Additionally, we introduce a conceptual framework for this industry, which involves the elements of the entire digital twin implementation process, and discuss the challenges faced during deployment, along with potential research opportunities. A proof-of-concept example is also presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed conceptual framework and potential of digital twins for enhanced sustainability.

Digital twins are beneficial to numerous industries, providing the capability to perform advanced analytics, create detailed simulations, and facilitate informed decision-making that IoT supports.

How to obtain the impact load on the cab quickly is one of the challenges in the design of a vehicle-mounted howitzer. In this paper, the deep learning (DL) method is introduced to solve the impact load on the cab. A fast prediction method for cab impact load based on a ConvLSTM multidimensional feature neural network is proposed. The calculation of the impact load on the cab under different operating conditions is achieved, and the solving speed is close to the real-time level. The numerical examples show that the accuracy of the DL model is comparable to that of traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, but the solving time is on the millisecond level. The computational efficiency has been greatly improved, with the potential for offline training and online computing. When there is a slight change in the morphology of the cab, the proposed model remains applicable. The results can quickly provide load conditions for cab strength checking and topology optimization, help to shorten the development period of a vehicle-mounted howitzer, and lay the foundation for the construction of a digital twin model of a vehicle-mounted howitzer system.

To address these concerns, industrial and academic efforts have worked towards developing a Digital Engineering (DE) ecosystem, one in which digitized documents connect and manage development for products. Within the DE environment, the Digital Twin (DT) stands as the atomic unit of construction, providing the building blocks upon which a successful DE environment rests. But not all value-informed aspects of a product are physical assets, and thus do not fall under the umbrella of a DT model. One such example is a unit manufacturing process (UMP), where a Digital Shadow provides relevant incoming streams of process data and simulation models exist to predict process outcomes; however, it is not a physical asset. Thus there are numerous challenges and multi-scale complexities associated with generating DTs of UMPs and their sub-scale attributes (machines, tooling, process physics, etc.), and with connecting these back to the DT of manufactured products. To combat this shortcoming currently present in DE, we propose the Digital Process Twin (DPT): a DT-like entity capable of bi-directional monitoring and optimization of UMPs. In this paper we detail what a DPT is, how it is represented, how it fits into the DE environment, and ending with a case study on surface finish milling of the advanced aerospace alloy γ-TiAl. This paper covers both the theory and practical application of a DPT, giving a well-rounded introduction to this extension of the DE ecosystem. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Engineering; Digital Twin; Surface Finishing; Unit Manufacturing Process","Finishing; Optimization; Surface treatment; Sustainable development; Digital engineering; Digital process; Engineering environment; Manufacturing process; Modular approach; Physical assets; Surface conditioning; Surface finishing; Surface process; Unit manufacturing process; Ecosystems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182645737"

Light field video (LFV), considered an intermediate transition scheme towards the metaverse, is conducive to sensing and reconstructing realistic scenes in the digital twins. However, the research on LFV systems still lacks comprehensive investigation, impeding their practical application. This paper addresses major technical challenges involved in LFV delivery through mobile networks, showing a trade-off between equipment cost, calibration effort, and workflow simplicity. It also considers the balance of communications and computations latency when maintaining reconstruction performance. Leveraging edge and cloud infrastructure, a novel Mobile Edge Assisted Multi-view Light-field-video System (MEAMLS) is proposed, integrating LFV collection, volumetric video construction, and an immersive viewing scheme. A custom-made LFV capture array is designed to capture real-world scenes, while employing a learning method-integrated edge server to facilitate adaptive LFV coding. Moreover, a fast sparse reconstruction algorithm is established, leveraging edge–cloud collaboration to minimize computation latency during volumetric video construction. Intelligent service for users is deployed on edge to enable viewport-driven virtual reality viewing. By providing an immersive visual experience, the proposed MEAMLS bridges the physical world and its digital twins.

The application of DT technology in smart manufacturing can provide accurate model support for the analysis of mechatronic equipment applications based on model simulations. However, for such a mechanics-electric-hydraulic-control coupled complex system of mechatronics equipment, how to quickly and effectively construct its consistent multi-domain DT mechanism model has become the biggest obstacle to the wide application of DT technology in this field. Therefore, based on the synthesis of existing model construction methods for mechatronics equipment, this paper proposes multi-domain, multi-level, parametric, and consistent mechatronics equipment DT mechanism model construction guidelines. Based on the proposed model construction guidelines, a DT mechanism model construction process for mechatronics equipment is given. Finally, a consistent multi-domain DT mechanism model of computer numerical control machine tools (CNCMT) is constructed by Simscape, to verify the feasibility of the proposed method.

We analyze these behaviors by employing a Markov Chain (MC) modeling approach that scrutinizes students' model construction and model debugging behaviors during CPS. This involves interpreting their actions in the system collected through computer logs and analyzing their conversations using a Large Language Model (LLM) as they progress through their modeling task in segments. Our analytical framework assesses the behaviors of high- and low-performing students by evaluating their proficiency in completing the specified computational model for a kinematics problem. We employ a mixed-methods approach, combining Markov Chain analysis of student problem-solving transitions with qualitative interpretations of their conversation segments.

Digital twins (DTs), providing timely expression of features and accurate digital representations, offers new possibilities to enhance the performance of mobile networks. However, the DT deployment and allocation of computing power during the construction of DT models may have detrimental effects on service quality. Wireless computing power networks (WCPNs), an emerging computing network architecture, can efficiently orchestrate the computing and networking resources of heterogeneous computing nodes, thereby providing efficient computing services. Based on this, we propose an architecture of WCPN-empowered DT systems and investigate the adaptive placement and transfer scheme for DTs. Considering the correlation among DTs of cooperating and computing entities (e.g., edge servers), we exploit the Shapley value of the cooperative game theory that fairly quantifies the contributions of the cooperating computing entities. To further cope with the time-varying characteristics of computing resource demands in mobile networks, with the powerful computational support of WCPN, we propose a DT transfer scheme based on Shapley value and double auction scheme.

When it comes to monitoring digital twins of objects, maintenance predictions in time play a significant role. This study targets an artificial intelligence-based prediction of time-series data integrated with fully consistent expert elicitation. It also allows the integration of expert knowledge into the construction and explanation of the predictor. Moreover, it is considered a hybrid approach using data and expert knowledge for time series prediction. Reliability of obtained prediction is examined through comparisons with basic dynamic and static forecasts. Decision-making analysis based on expert's opinions and optimization science coincides to prepare the data set for ANN prediction. Thus, the maintenance process will become predictable over time. Moreover, this prediction avoids sudden overhaul cost. Therefore, the entire production system is kept controlled. In this research, a FUll COnsistently Method (FUCOM) of optimization together with Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is used for obtaining optimal weights. Then, dynamic and static time-series forecasts are compared with ANN prediction. The obtained results prove ANN reliability according to expert's opinions and FUCOM optimization model.

This is evident given the lack of digital as-designed models for older buildings, which can serve as a reference for as-is conditions modelling, and their unreliability for newer buildings. However, detecting the connectivity between entities for effective construction of a geometric Digital Twin from Point Cloud Datasets is an unsolved problem. This work defines a new problem, connectivity detection in buildings from Point Cloud Datasets. To solve it, we define a surface topology graph that represents relationships between labelled surfaces and propose a deep-geometric-neural-network-based framework to reconstruct the graph. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS dataset demonstrate that our method achieves high performance in relation detection. The practical application for structural object detection further validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach and highlights the value of relations. The findings of this study contribute to the advancement of the construction of Digital Twins, facilitating the efficient analysis and reasoning of objects, spaces, and entire buildings within the Digital Twin framework. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Construction of geometric digital twins; Existing building digitisation; Geometric digital twin; Geometry digitisation; Object detection; Relation detection; Scan to BIM","Architectural design; Geometry; Object detection; Object recognition; Topology; Construction of geometric digital twin; Digitisation; Existing building digitization; Geometric digital twin; Geometry digitization; Objects detection; Point-clouds; Relation detection; Scan to BIM; Construction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184751797"

In this research, we put forward distinct levels of detail for geometry and material inputs, specifically tailored for indoor daylight applications. We primarily focus on understanding the uncertainties arising from imprecise estimations of material optical properties and incomplete geometrical inputs in climate-based indoor daylight simulations. Employing a Monte Carlo approach, we analyzed six office and teaching spaces, creating 20 variations for each by altering geometrical completeness and material accuracy. The technique of excluding non-permanent objects below certain sizes in four graduated steps was used to derive and test the impact of various geometrical levels of detail. Our findings reveal that different levels of geometrical completeness lead to errors ranging from 1.08% to 18.05%. Additionally, a twofold increase in simulation time was noted when geometrical detail was enhanced relative to the most basic model. Errors stemming from imprecise definitions of material optical properties showed a normal distribution. The uncertainty in simulation outcomes showed a linear rise with increasing input material uncertainty, lying between 10% to 30%, depending on space configurations. We observed heightened uncertainty near openings, attributed to window transmittance effects. The research underscores that daylight predictions are markedly more sensitive to transmittance uncertainties than to those in reflectance, regardless of the window-to-floor ratio. These insights may help to guide a more efficient data acquisition process of indoor spaces for daylight simulations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin; Digitization; Interior; LOD; Retrofit","Geometry; Normal distribution; Optical properties; Building model; Built environment; Daylight applications; Digitisation; Interior; Level-of-detail; LOD; Retrofit; Simulation of buildings; Uncertainty; Data acquisition","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183453468"

Parallel to this, typical simulation tools fail to integrate the entirety of the aspects related to the complexity of AV applications, such as data communication delay, security, and the integration of software/hardware-in-the-loop and other simulation tools. This work proposes a SmartData-based middleware to integrate AV simulators and external tools. The interface models the data used on a simulator and creates an intermediary layer between the simulator and the external tools by defining the inputs and outputs as SmartData. A message bus is used for communication between SmartData following their Interest relations. Messages are exchanged following a specific protocol. Nevertheless, the architecture presented is agnostic of protocol. Moreover, we present a data-centric AV design integrated into the middleware. The design considers the standardization of the data interfaces between AV components, including sensing, perception, planning, decision, and actuation. Therefore, the presented design promotes a transparent integration of the AV simulation with other simulators (e.g., network simulators), cloud services, fault injection mechanisms, digital twins, and hardware-in-the-loop scenarios. Moreover, the design allows for transparent, runtime component replacement and time synchronization, the modularization of the vehicle components, and the addition of security aspects in the simulation. We present a case-study application with an AV simulation using CARLA, and we measure the end-to-end delay and overhead incurred in the simulation by our middleware. An increase in the end-to-end delay was measured once data communication was not acknowledged in the original scenario, and data was assumed to be ready for processing with no communication delay between sensors, decision-making, and actuation units. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autonomous vehicle; Data-driven systems; Simulation middleware; Simulation tools","Application programs; Autonomous vehicles; Convolutional codes; Decision making; Middleware; Modular construction; Network architecture; Autonomous Vehicles; Communication delays; Data centric; Data driven; Data-communication; Data-driven system; Driven system; Simulation middleware; Simulation tool; Vehicle simulation; Data integration","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181503174"

This low-power SN requires less than 21 mJ for a full processing: measurement, data formatting, and transmission of a 17-bytes LoRaWAN frame; id est 39μJ per transmitted bit. It is designed to be buried in reinforced concrete and is battery-free and energy autonomous for long-term deployment by a radiative electromagnetic wireless power transfer (WPT) approach. The SN is cold-start compatible down to a power of-17 dBm available at the output of the antenna. It is able to wirelessly transmit data over at least tens of meters thanks to the LoRaWAN wireless communication technology. Moreover, it is wirelessly, remotely, and omnidirectionally powered and controlled by a communicating node (CN) over meters, with the respect of regional regulatory constraints (equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of +33 dBm allowed in the 868-MHz industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) frequency band). By being a generic platform, this SN can employ various sensors to measure relevant parameters for the targeted application, id est: temperature, relative humidity, mechanical deformation through the strain, and electrical resistivity whose the variation allows to estimate the corrosion rate. By simultaneously using the same 868-MHz ISM frequency band for the wireless communication and the WPT, the SN meets the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer paradigm with a unique antenna and without interferences. Thus, the tested system allows the deployment of the subnetwork of two CNs and several SNs (currently four) to cover a surface/volume of several meters, currently up to 11 m around each CN indoors.

Given the dynamic and evolving characteristics of the physical world, a huge volume of data transmission and exchange is necessary to attain synchronized updates in the virtual world. In this article, we propose a semantic communication framework based on you only look once (YOLO) to construct a virtual apple orchard with the aim of mitigating the costs associated with data transmission. Specifically, we first employ the YOLOv7-X object detector to extract semantic information from captured images of edge devices, thereby reducing the volume of transmitted data and saving transmission costs. Afterwards, we quantify the importance of each semantic information by the confidence generated through the object detector. Based on this, we propose two resource allocation schemes, i.e., the confidence-based scheme and the acrlong AI-generated scheme, aimed at enhancing the transmission quality of important semantic information. The proposed diffusion model generates an optimal allocation scheme that outperforms both the average allocation scheme and the confidence-based allocation scheme. Moreover, to obtain semantic information more effectively, we enhance the detection capability of the YOLOv7-X object detector by introducing new efficient layer aggregation network-horNet (ELAN-H) and SimAM attention modules, while reducing the model parameters and computational complexity, making it easier to run on edge devices with limited performance. The numerical results indicate that our proposed semantic communication framework and resource allocation schemes significantly reduce transmission costs while enhancing the transmission quality of important information in communication services. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twins; object detection; resource allocation; semantic communication","Cost reduction; Data transfer; Edge detection; Network layers; Object detection; Semantics; Virtual reality; Image edge detection; Object detectors; Objects detection; Physical world; Resource management; Resources allocation; Semantic communication; Semantics Information; Virtual worlds; Wireless communications; Resource allocation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173060990"

Some state departments of transportation (DOTs) in the U.S. have already adopted draft versions of ASCE 75 and are attempting to use it to assist their efforts to standardize and expedite their utility accommodation, permitting, and highway project coordination regulations and procedures. In alignment with these efforts, the Federal Highway Administration’s “Every Day Counts Round Six” initiative illustrates the importance of digital as-built (DAB) records by stating that their implementation can enhance safety, quality, and cost savings. However, there is no standard practice for the general construction DABs. Therefore, this study illustrates the benefits of implementing the ASCE 75 utility as-built standard and its potential impact on DABs for general construction. This study used a research methodology comprised of interviewing state DOTs, and a comprehensive literature assessment. The benefits of implementing ASCE 75 include improved data exchange methods among the project stakeholders and the collection and exchange of data about subsurface and above-ground utilities’ location and other attributes. Moreover, ASCE 75 provides a framework for all infrastructure projects. Also, the study highlights how ASCE 75 is adopted across the state DOTs and how it presents a path forward beyond just developing a utility as-built standard. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","infrastructure; roadway design; utilities","Highway administration; Highway planning; 'current; American Society of Civil Engineering; Geo-spatial data; Infrastructure; Provide guidances; Roadway design; Standard guidelines; State departments of transportations; Utility; Utility infrastructure; Electronic data interchange","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165614258"

Building information modeling (BIM) integration has become a key strategy to foster efficiency, collaboration, and sustainability in the fields of buildings, transport, and facilities. Currently, there is a scarcity of comprehensive examinations of the performance of integrated BIM with transport facilities and applications to help identify potential prospects for sustainable development. Hence, this research paper attempts to scrutinize the integration of BIM, transportation, and facilities (T and Fs) by highlighting future directions and trends, revealing the existing status and hotspots of research in the field, and clarifying the developmental pulse of research as well as emerging areas in the future. A quantitative research technique is utilized in this study, using VOSviewer and CiteSpace software, and the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. The study findings suggest that the hot keywords for the integration of BIM and T and Fs are predominantly concentrated on construction, framework, system, design, and management. In addition, over the previous 34 years (years 1989 to 2023), the applications of point cloud, digital twin, and life cycle assessment have been the current hot topics, and these emerging technologies can offer more innovative breakthroughs for the future. Furthermore, the integration of BIM and T and Fs represents an important trend that is essential for improving the efficiency, sustainability, and intelligence of buildings and infrastructure, from which the three domains can create synergies that contribute to the better planning, construction, and management of building and infrastructure projects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","bibliometric; building information modeling (BIM); digital twins; life cycle assessment (LCA); point cloud; transportation","Architectural design; Construction; Efficiency; Information theory; Integration; Project management; Sustainable development; Bibliometric; Building information modeling; Building Information Modelling; Comprehensive examination; Daily lives; Future perspectives; Life cycle assessment; Mode of transport; Models integration; Point-clouds; Life cycle","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185566901"

Through the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors that are installed on TBM, the actual operating status is transferred from the physical object to the digital model. Deep learning models that integrated graph convolutional network (GCN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are employed for reliable TBM performance estimation. An online multi-objective optimization (MOO) approach is then proposed to determine the optimal operating parameters for advanced control. Real data from Singapore's Circle Line 6 C885 project is utilized as a case study to examine the applicability of the developed digital twin model. TBM's penetration rate, over-excavation ratio, energy consumption, and tool wear are selected as the objectives (O<inf>1</inf> to O<inf>4</inf>) for optimization. The results indicate that (1) The digital twin model can provide a reliable estimation of TBM's performance indicators with a high coefficient of determination (R2) values. (2) TBM's overall performance can be effectively improved through the proposed online optimization method, with an overall improvement of 21.12%. (3) The proposed online optimization method is more practical and creates better improvement than the conventional MOO approach. This study addresses the existing research gaps of lacking a reliable method to guide TBM operation with enhanced performances for the major objectives.

However, current workpiece postures still rely on manual judgments based on workers' experience, which has become one of major issues hindering the further advancement of intelligent welding systems towards mass production. To cope with this issue, aiming at four typical regular butt joints, a systematic tackling framework is proposed and carried out from posture description, posture feature construction, posture metrics to visualization model reconstruction. At a core, the prototype feature is proposed to characterize pre-welding workpiece postures and a series of text characters based on it is introduced to describe various anomalous workpiece postures including concurrent tilt, misalignment, seam variation, and stacking between them. A comprehensive process for constructing prototype features is performed from data acquisition, image processing to key point search, among which the algorithms for extracting differential features of different seam types are integrated. Based on the constructed prototype features, several posture metric parameters are defined, and workpiece posture models can be easily reconstructed. In addition, the good generalizability of the proposed framework for seam types with regular edge and seam features is also discussed. Ultimately, experimental results show that the prototype feature-based posture description of the pre-welding workpiece can efficiently and accurately characterize multiple anomalous postures. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anomalous workpiece posture analysis; Intelligent welding system; Mass welding process development; Prototype feature; Workpiece posture model reconstruction","Butt welding; Data mining; Image processing; Intelligent robots; Parameter extraction; Anomalous workpiece posture analyse; Intelligent welding; Intelligent welding system; Mass welding process development; Modeling reconstruction; Posture analysis; Posture modeling; Process development; Prototype features; Welding process; Welding systems; Workpiece; Workpiece posture model reconstruction; Data acquisition","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180361804"

Virtual upgrades are being made to manufacturing systems to keep up with the need for faster product cycles, higher quality, and the introduction of Industry 4.0 technologies. The design and development of new mechatronic discrete manufacturing machines (MDMM) should thus include these characteristics in their design. However, most machine builders do not have the capabilities and resources to do virtual engineering (VE) at the required level, which means these machines are made with limitations or sometimes without their virtual counterparts. Reusable VE MDMM modularization allows machine builders to obtain these competencies quickly and with fewer resources. This research proposes developing adaptable digital twins (DT) by modularizing all virtual and physical mechatronic machine aspects. DTs are well-explored in literature, but re-engineering them requires massive resources and is often unviable. We introduce a new DT-based approach that allows machine builders to quickly re-engineer, adapt, and test machines, given its modular confined approach. Although VE on different abstraction levels still must be developed, confined modularization allows hiding the complexity into modules rather than addressing the entire machine simultaneously. Building machines through modularization is thus an investment, as machine builders and other stakeholders will be able to use and reuse them later for other machines, reducing the overall resources that go into the development. The paper shows how to develop adaptable DT machines using Siemens tools related to virtual engineering. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptability; Digital Twins; Machine Development; Modularization; Reconfigurability; Virtual Engineering","Modular construction; Adaptability; Design and Development; Digital machines; Discrete manufacturing; Machine builders; Machine development; Manufacturing machine; Modularizations; Reconfigurability; Virtual engineering; Machine design","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179134338"

Digital twin (DT) effectively supports high-fidelity modelling, virtual-real mapping, and analysis-based decision-making but with research in the initial stage. To begin with, this paper delves into the complexity and uncertainty inherent in tunnel construction, highlighting DT as a promising solution compared to exisiting technologies such as Building Information Modelling. Then, a systematic literature survey is conducted, revealing growing focus on DT research topics. To provide comprehensive insights into DT-related technologies and their application in tunnel construction, this paper clusters literature from perspectives of sensor networks, Internet of Things (IoT), computer vision-based twin data acquisition, communication, natural language processing (NLP), automatic control-based connection, and geometric, semantic, analytical integrated twin modelling. These aspects shed light on potentials and limitations of existing researh in developing a functional DT.

In this article, certain existing data-driven methods are first introduced for model construction of a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) rotary engine. However, due to the prediction transient response and the associated stability not being guaranteed, a hybrid observer/Kalman filter identification (OKID) scheme is proposed. The presented method uses autoregressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX) model for modeling and involves a deadbeat observer design, which can allow model outputs to converge to real output in a theoretical proof. The identified models are seen as the digital twins of a healthy system, which can be taken as a reference to monitor the status of the UAV rotary engine. For comparison study, three data-driven methods, including neural network (NN), fast orthogonal search (FOS), and the proposed OKID hybrid model, are assessed by their model accuracy, stability, and convergence through practical flight data. Experimental results show that the developed method is the best alternative for online fault detection even in the face of limited training data. Moreover, given the real test flight data, the proposed OKID hybrid model can identify the anomaly status and figure out the abnormal part of the fixed-wing rotary engine, which greatly contributes to field managers for maintenance policy decision-making. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Aircraft accidents; Aircraft detection; Aircraft engines; Anomaly detection; Antennas; Decision making; Fault detection; Fixed wings; Maintenance; Rotary engines; Training aircraft; Transient analysis; Aerial vehicle; Autoregressive modelling; Complexes structure; Data-driven methods; Flight data; Hybrid model; Hybrid observer; Model construction; Stability analyze; Drones","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177073794"

Design/methodology/approach: A positivist approach with elements of interpretivism is adopted to allow to capture what is perceived as “reality” in relation to individuals’ interpretation and experience in the use and implementation of MBT. This is achieved by using a mixed qualitative-quantitative approach that can capture the various understandings of MBT. The research methods included a longitudinal case study over 12 months, two project workshops, expert interviews and an industry survey that together helped to investigate MBT at project, enterprise and industry levels. Findings: The MBT requirements taxonomy included requirements relating to both project and organisation. Project requirements addressed MBT functionalities for sites and information management, while organisation requirements focused on the integration of MBT solutions with the enterprise from information technology, legal and security perspectives. A detailed matrix showing the interactions between five key MBT features and seven construction management functions was also developed. Research limitations/implications: The two constructs developed by this study can help researchers to structure their investigation of key uses of MBT applications and their benefits. It can be used by researchers aiming to investigate integrated approaches to the digitalisation of construction sites, such as those enabled by Digital Twins. The interaction matrix can aid researchers in evaluating the intersections between the MBT functionalities and the site construction management functions (e.g. theoretical analysis of interactions from Lean Construction, benefit evaluation perspective). More broadly, the two constructs can support research and practice investigating the development of data-driven approaches on construction sites. Practical implications: The developed MBT taxonomy can guide construction organisations in selecting suitable MBT for Field BIM for their projects. It can also act as a baseline against which varying MBT solutions can be compared. Originality/value: Constructs such as taxonomies for MBTs; an understanding of MBT capabilities and use within the industry; and a lack of delineation between related terms, such as Mobile BIM, Field BIM, Site BIM, Cloud BIM and Mobile Apps, were lacking in the literature.

However, 3D applications in construction currently produce large volumes of unstructured data and unusable point clouds, which are time-consuming to convert into an interactive environment for Building Information Modelling (BIM) or Digital Twins. While radiance field rendering methods are increasingly gaining traction, the adoption of generated Neural Radiance Fields or Gaussian Splatting models by digital construction technology is still tentative. This study introduces a framework that uses Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to improve 3D inspection and maintenance on construction sites. It merges NeRF’s high-resolution, real-time 3D modelling with an interactive platform, facilitating detailed remote site analysis and defect detection. The framework incorporates a custom version of TurboNeRF, tailored specifically for construction site inspections.

Two primary methods are used to generate base data in urban river spaces: LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and camera-based techniques. The LiDAR method is particularly advantageous due to its ability to directly measure distance data, making the generation of point clouds relatively easy. However, the point cloud generation process in mobile mapping systems using LiDAR is highly dependent on the accuracy of the external orientation parameters, requiring high-performance GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) systems, making the equipment expensive and complex. In contrast, camera-based methods, primarily using Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS), offer a more cost-effective alternative for point cloud generation, although they are slower than LiDAR. Despite the longer processing time, camera-based systems are inexpensive to build and deploy. Simultaneous localization and mapping using LiDAR (LiDAR-SLAM) combined with GNSS positioning has been shown to be effective for 3D measurements in urban river environments. However, in cases where high-frequency 3D measurements or anomaly detection in civil engineering structures are required, camera-based methods offer advantages over LiDAR, such as improved flexibility and adaptability. A major challenge in wide-area camera measurements with cameras is the increased processing time due to the enormous number of captured images required to generate point clouds. To address this issue, this study proposes a method to improve the efficiency of point cloud measurements in urban river environments. This includes the use of omnidirectional cameras to increase the acquisition efficiency and the development of a method to optimize the SfM/MVS processing. Specifically, the study explores the estimation of an omnidirectional camera network that takes into account the fixed baseline relationships between cameras and the improved multi-perspective capabilities achieved through round-trip image acquisition. These innovations are expected to significantly reduce processing time while maintaining the accuracy and reliability of the generated point clouds, offering a promising approach for efficient urban river space measurements. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Camera network estimation; Multi-view stereo; Structure from Motion; Water-borne MMS","Concrete dams; Crystal lattices; Frequency estimation; Geological surveys; Gluing; Image acquisition; Image enhancement; Network security; Photointerpretation; Photomapping; Steganography; Stereo image processing; Camera network; Camera network estimation; Camera-based; Light detection and ranging; Multi-view stereo; Point-clouds; Structure from motion; Urban river; Water-borne; Water-borne MMS; Global positioning system","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217793708"

These systems integrate state-of-the-art engineering principles and advanced materials to ensure reliability and optimal performance in formidable conditions. Through intricate movements and precise positioning, OPTS enable optimal access during personnel transfer operations and prove indispensable in navigating unpredictable weather conditions. While material considerations play a role in their design, this paper focuses on the dynamic design strategies employed in the construction of OPTS. Within this study, the Moving Frame Method (MFM) emerges as an optimal framework for analysis. Rooted in the foundational principles of Lie Group Theory and Cartan’s notion of moving reference frames, the MFM provides an efficient means of analyzing single and multi-body dynamics. By harnessing the capabilities of the Special Euclidean Group for analysis and simulation, this paper illustrates how the MFM serves as a catalyst for advanced research. Furthermore, recent extensions, notably the development of a kinematic transfer variable, improve the algorithm for the MFM. Complementing this analytical approach, the integration of WebGL for 3D simulations offers a visually immersive experience, fostering a comprehensive understanding of system behavior and performance dynamics. This project (revisiting legacy software with modern mathematics) serves as a pivotal step towards the seamless integration of smart technologies within OPTS. Through the incorporation of real-time monitoring, sensor feedback, automated control systems, and a real-time physics model, the next phase of OPTS promises unparalleled levels of operational efficiency and safety by the creation of a digital twin. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Kinematics and Dynamics; Dynamics; Machine Dynamics; Mechanical Systems Modeling of Dynamics Systems","Man machine systems; Marine engineering; Structural dynamics; Systems analysis; Computational kinematic and dynamic; Kinematics and dynamics; Machine dynamics; Mechanical system modeling of dynamic system; Mechanical systems; Modeling of dynamics; Moving frame; Offshores; System models; Transfer systems; Optimal systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217222206"

A main challenge in robot deployment is how to best place the robot within the workcell. To tackle this challenge, we combine two knowledge sources: robotic knowledge of the system and workcell context awareness of the user, and intersect them with an Augmented Reality interface. RobotGraffiti is a unique tool that empowers the user in robot deployment tasks. One simply takes a 3D scan of the workcell with their mobile device, adds contextual data points that otherwise would be difficult to infer from the system, and receives a robot base position that satisfies the automation task. The proposed approach is an alternative to expensive and time-consuming digital twins, with a fast and easy-to-use tool that focuses on selected workcell features needed to run the placement optimization algorithm. The main contributions of this paper are the novel user interface for robot base placement data collection and a study comparing the traditional offline simulation with our proposed method.

Recognizing the wireless environment is also essential for designing wireless power transfer to sensors simultaneously with data transmission. One of the methods for recognizing the wireless environment is a radio environment map (REM), which visualizes the statistical results of measured received power and communication quality by linking them to location information. This method requires node's location information that is difficult to accurately locate indoors in a practical environment. In this paper, we propose a method to construct a REM with nodes whose locations are estimated by using a position estimation method. Measurement nodes recognize the wireless environment while autonomously estimating their position. We measured the received power of private 5G, a type of private network, in a smart factory and constructed a REM using a position estimation method based on bluetooth low energy beacons.

Firstly, according to the response distribution of the floating wind turbine, the response characteristics in different scenarios are extracted based on the autoencoder. And the response characteristics are clustered to form a control interval with response as the measurement index, which provides a basis for the partitioning in the construction of digital twin models for floating wind turbines.

Understanding how digital tools and processes, including BIM-based workflows and digital twin applications, impact the psychological and physiological states of construction workers is crucial for improving safety, productivity, and overall job satisfaction. This study integrates construction practices and neuroscience by systematically reviewing quantitative parameters and tools for assessing worker well-being within various digital construction workflows, with a specific focus on BIM and digital twin applications. We identify key stress detection parameters (e.g., EDA, HRV) and tools from medical research applicable to construction management for enhancing worker well-being and mitigating risks. A comprehensive literature review synthesizes findings from multiple disciplines, focusing on stress detection techniques and their application in optimizing digital construction processes, specifically within BIM-driven projects and the development and utilization of digital twins. Results highlight stress detection parameters and tools offering valuable insights into worker experience, emphasizing the need for both qualitative and quantitative measures in project management, particularly within the context of BIM and digital twin technologies. A holistic, interdisciplinary approach merging ergonomics, neuroscience, and construction methodologies is crucial for enhancing worker experience in increasingly digitalized construction environments. Integrating stress detection technologies into construction management processes, especially those leveraging BIM and digital twins, is essential for promoting worker well-being and safety, while acknowledging limitations in current systematic research. Future exploration includes developing human-centered digital tools within BIM and digital twin workflows and applying medical findings to improve construction workflows.

However, users of active back-support exoskeletons are susceptible to various physical and psychological risks, which could be exoskeleton-type or task-dependent. A test bed is needed to enable deployment and assessment of risks associated with exoskeleton use for construction tasks. This study presents a human-in-the-loop digital twin framework for assessing ergonomic risks associated with using active back-support exoskeletons for construction work. Through a literature review, a digital twin system architecture for assessing risks associated with active back-support exoskeletons was developed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to identify construction tasks that are most suitable for active back-support exoskeletons. Based on the identified tasks, a laboratory experiment was conducted to quantify the risks associated with the use of a commercially available active back-support exoskeleton for carpentry framing tasks. The efficacy of the digital twin framework is demonstrated with an example of the classification of exertion levels due to exoskeleton use using a 1D-convolutional neural network. The results show that the performance of the model improved significantly with synthetic data. The dashboard provides a visualization of exertion risk classification outcomes to aid decision-making. The study highlights the potential of digital twins for ergonomic assessment, allowing stakeholders to proactively address ergonomic risks and optimize the use of exoskeletons in the construction industry.

The European Clean Hydrogen Alliance has developed an investment agenda to support the strategic investment of hydrogen amounting to 9.3 billion €. Hydrogen is a potential fuel source but is not readily available in nature for direct combustion. Pure hydrogen can be synthesised by electrolyser to produce hydrogen. To ensure the success of transitioning the glass industry to using hydrogen, there are several factors to consider apart from the cost of electrolyser. Most of the publication focuses mainly on the efficiency, cost and the direct application of the electrolyser in Europe. However, there is a gap in empirical studies that provide challenges and needs with the use of hydrogen in glass manufacturers. In this work, we aim to key factors to provide new insights regarding the adoption of hydrogen in the manufacturing sector. The case study was carried out with 4 European glass manufacturers that plan to use hydrogen as a fuel or have tested it on small scales. Workshops were organized with experts from different fields for solution development. All 4 glass manufacturers have an objective to reduce GHG emissions and explore the use of H2 to replace natural gas but lack the knowledge in the management, particularly the safety aspects, of H2 in furnaces. Factors such as the safety of hydrogen, required furnace modifications and the development of smart production management should be focused on integrating hydrogen into the glass manufacturing industry. One challenge is that the available data are mostly on the combustion of natural gas and not from hydrogen making development prediction using digital twins challenging. This insight could also contribute to the replicability of the developed solutions for other industries like aluminium and cement. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","case study; factors; glass industry; Hydrogen; manufacturing","Cement industry; Concrete construction; Glass manufacture; Investments; Safety glass; Case-studies; CO2 emissions; Direct combustion; Electrolysers; Factor; Fuel source; Glass-manufacturing; Key factors; Manufacturing industries; Strategic investments; Glass industry","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213065591"

This review focuses on how Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) are being leveraged to tackle these issues. It specifically explores AI’s role in predicting air pollution, improving material quality, monitoring worker health and safety, and enhancing Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) for construction. This study evaluates various AI and ML models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines SVMs, as well as optimization techniques like whale and moth flame optimization. These tools are assessed for their ability to predict air pollutant levels, improve concrete quality, and monitor worker safety in real time. Research papers were also reviewed to understand AI’s application in predicting the compressive strength of materials like cement mortar, fly ash, and stabilized clay soil. The performance of these models is measured using metrics such as coefficient of determination (R2), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Furthermore, AI has shown promise in predicting and reducing emissions of air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO<inf>2</inf>, CO, SO<inf>2</inf>, and O<inf>3</inf>. In addition, it improves construction material quality and ensures worker safety by monitoring health indicators like standing postures, electrocardiogram, and galvanic skin response. It is also concluded that AI technologies, including Explainable AI and Petri Nets, are also making advancements in CPS for the construction industry. The models’ performance metrics indicate they are well-suited for real-time construction operations. The study highlights the adaptability and effectiveness of these technologies in meeting current and future construction needs. However, gaps remain in certain areas of research, such as broader AI integration across diverse construction environments and the need for further validation of models in real-world applications. Finally, this research underscores the potential of AI and ML to revolutionize the construction industry by promoting sustainable practices, improving operational efficiency, and addressing safety concerns. It also provides a roadmap for future research, offering valuable insights for industry stakeholders interested in adopting AI technologies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","air pollutants; concrete; constructions 4.0; environmental sustainability; intelligent monitoring; machine learning; physiological signals; predictive analysis","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212946346"

As the representation, the digital twin serves many purposes: automating processes, improving decision-making for particular processes, and facilitating the simulation of various scenarios. The identified approach reduces complexity and concentrates on essential subjects, objects, and processes from a stakeholder perspective. The authors of this paper propose a Viewpoint Oriented Subject-Object Meta-Model (ViPOSOM) that can provide initial requirements for digital twin solution development for smart agriculture. The main idea is to identify the main objects with characteristics and relationships within their development phases for the life cycle. This approach's novelty lies in identifying the sensing requirements of the object/entity. The approach targets an agricultural physical entity changing its structure and behavior over time. By 'physical entity', the authors mean artifacts such as crops and vegetables. The paper also describes the real-life application of the proposed approach with the Living Lab of potato plants in a small-scale experimental field. Unlike the digital twin in manufacturing or civil engineering, agricultural objects face significant uncertainties regarding the internal changes of the physical entity (object), which defines the necessity to apply a method that uses time scale and development phase as the main characteristics of the physical entity in the digital object. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Twin; Internet of Things; Meta-modelling; Smart Agriculture","Automating process; Conceptual model; Decisions makings; Development phasis; Main objects; Meta model; Metamodeling; Process Improving; Smart agricultures; Technological solution","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212675022"

By itself, this makes the design of such a system to be challenging. With the addition of new trends such as artificial intelligence (AI), the use of multicore processors, reconfigurable computing and many others, designing avionics systems is becoming even more complex. These trends allow new capabilities, but we also need to provide confidence to maintain the safety and security of avionics systems. One possible approach is a CPS design using formal models of computation (MoCs), such as the synchronous (SY) and synchronous dataflow (SDF). MoCs are mathematical rules that dictate how software or hardware computations are executed. With that approach, one can design a system at a high-level of abstraction and achieve a correct-by-construction implementation. Avionics systems are safety-critical due to their hard real-time requirements. That would require the designers to model avionics using a timed MoC, such as the SY. On the other hand, runtime reconfiguration can be modeled at a higher level of abstraction using MoCs that are based on the SDF, such as the scenario-aware dataflow (SADF). Therefore, that scenario requires a heterogeneous modeling mixing both timed and untimed MoCs, which is a gap we target in this paper. Here, we introduce the interfaces for communication between the SY and SDF MoCs in a functional programming paradigm framework, allowing heterogeneous system modeling mixing timed and untimed MoCs at a high-level of abstraction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyber-physical systems; Heterogeneous systems; Models of computation; Safety-critical systems","Embedded software; Integrated circuit design; Multicore programming; Problem oriented languages; Reconfigurable hardware; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Systems analysis; Avionic systems; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Heterogeneous system model; Heterogeneous systems; High level of abstraction; Model mixing; Model of computation; Safety critical systems; Synchronous Dataflow; Data flow analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211195107"

This article introduces an extension of the W3C Web of Things (WoT) Thing Descriptions (TD) ontology, called “WoTDT” (WoT Digital Twin ontology). The WoTDT ontology is based on the most widely adopted architecture that models DTws into five dimensions. Furthermore, since the ontology has been created as a WoT extension, it will offer benefits such as enabling the discovery of services [1] across dimensions or enhancing the accessibility [2] of the information from a specific dimension, thereby promoting data interoperability. In addition, an evaluation of the ontology has been performed to ensure its quality by verifying that it is pitfall-free and covers all identified requirements.

In order to manage and control this ageing mechanism and to prevent unexpected fatigue damage a monitoring system is needed which is able to predict fatigue damage before it occurs. It is composed of a hardware part and a software part. The hardware consists of simple and robust accelerometers or displacement sensors that measure the vibrations at a few key selected points of the structure. The software is a program that identifies the contribution of each dynamic vibration mode in the measured vibrations and transforms this information into an estimation of remaining lifetime at each location of interest. Implementation steps are the one-time generation of a digital twin of the monitored structure, the continuous acceleration measurement and the cyclic signal processing. The comparison of each single mode displacement with the modal basis of the digital twin leads to the stress time history (full stress tensor as a function of time) at the fatigue relevant locations of the structure. A rainflow algorithm allows for the counting of the cycles and the identification of partial and cumulative fatigue usage factors. Extrapolation of results allows for a remaining fatigue lifetime estimation. The visualization of results includes the plot of fatigue usage as a function of operation time. Potential application examples are given in terms of distillation columns (chemical industry), wind mill tower structures (wind energy industry) and piping systems (chemical industry, nuclear and conventional power plants) including small bore piping with well-known fatigue sensitivities at socket welds. An exemplary hardware layout for wind mill tower structures will be given. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","acceleration measurement; digital twin; Vibrational Fatigue Monitoring","Acceleration measurement; Arctic buildings; Cements; Chemical plants; Concrete construction; Liquefied petroleum gas; Mineral oils; Nuclear industry; Nuclear power plants; Oil shale; Petroleum tar; Small power plants; Vibration measurement; Aging mechanism; Application fields; Fatigue monitoring; Industrial structures; Monitoring approach; Monitoring system; Technical applications; Tower structures; Vibrational fatigue monitoring; Wind mill; Chemical industry","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210241741"

Nevertheless, the planning in both industries is generally done separately and there is not enough communication which leads to problems later on in the process. In the automotive industry, the digital twin is already used as a common tool for the planning and simulation of production lines. In the building industry however, the digitalization is not as well-advanced. Since the workflows, the degree of digitalization and the used software tools differ so much, the combination of the different processes and data of the automotive industry and the building industry is still very difficult nowadays. In order to solve that problem, the aim is to develop a common structure that allows both industries to collaborate and share their data, starting early on in the planning process. The current workflows of both industries were analyzed by conducting interviews with experts in their field. Evaluation of the answers and further discussion in the interdisciplinary team of the research project “CoLab4DigiTwin” showed that the workflows of both industries actually have the similar approach of starting the planning process by thinking in three-dimensional spaces that get more detailed information over time. Based on this finding, a hierarchical technical structure was developed, combining the spaces of the building industry and the automotive industry. This structure acts as a clear common base that facilitates an organized data exchange and improves the interdisciplinary collaboration. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Building Information Modeling; Built environment; Collaboration platform; Industry 4.0; Plant engineering; Sustainable interoperability","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209890038"

Nevertheless, existing equipment systems do not provide such an environment because they are focused on the operation itself, and there are time and financial limitations in establishing a monitoring and control platform environment in equipment systems intended for small-quantity production. This paper verified data collection, simulation-based analysis, and control on an actual clothing production micro-factory system for verifying the operation behavior. Experimentally, we performed the operation verification of the proposed CPS methodology.

In the context of demand response (DR), the real-time bidirectional communication characteristic of DT allows for functions such as real-time energy forecast and decision making aid, which provided high potential in DR applications due to the nature of DR being highly time sensitive. The objective of this paper is to explore the concept and application of DT in the domain of DR, as there are currently limited numbers of review on this topic. It was identified that most work in this area shows promising results but is still exploratory. The main application of DT in the domain of DR is using DT as an enabling tool by leveraging the real-time and data processing function of DT for monitoring and decision-making, and providing a medium for better visualisation. Future studies can experiment with applying DT frameworks to larger case studies, and apply more elaborate DT with higher maturity levels. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","building information modeling (BIM); built environment; digital twin","Accurate modeling; Bi-directional communication; Building information modeling; Building Information Modelling; Built environment; Demand response; Emerging trends; Energy; Large amounts; Real- time","Article","aip","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209379395"

Considering the unknown complex industrial system models, the intelligent methods for distributed sensing are received extensive attention. In most existing works, the system observability is assumed strictly first to obtain complete sensing information for subsequent state estimation. But with the expansion of industrial monitoring network scale, the observability requirement is increasingly difficult to be satisfied in advance. Therefore, a new distributed intelligent sensing method with guaranteed observability is proposed for ICPS in this paper. Specifically, a distributed learning mechanism based on field level data is designed to dynamically approximate the distributed sensing process. Then, the learning weight complete update condition is provided to actively guarantee the observability, and the novel convex-set construction approach is proposed to handle the non-convex property of this condition. Besides, the learning convergence speed and error bound are analyzed in detail. Finally, the proposed method is applied into the industrial hot rolling laminar cooling process based on the established simulation system. Compared with state-of-the-art methods in distributed intelligent sensing, the proposed method can actively reduce the sensing cost while improving the sensing performance with guaranteed observability. An average overall improvement of 24.1% in the normalized sensing performance and selection number of sensing terminals is achieved, which provides a solution for the upgrade of intelligent sensing of key processes in similar ICPS. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Distributed sensing; industrial cyber-physical system; intelligent; network; observability","Observability; Condition; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Distributed sensing; Industrial cybe-physical system; Intelligent; Intelligent sensing; Key process; Network; Sensing performance; State estimation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209147029"

The development of a simulation model for the network of production facilities and the distribu-tion chain of ready-made concrete mixtures is a key element of the project to create a digital twin in the pro-duction and logistics of a concrete plant. The relevance of this study is supported by the fact that post-war res-toration of the destroyed housing stock, reconstruction of damaged infrastructure and industrial buildings, and the resumption of work at all construction sites in the country will lead to a sharp increase in the demand for concrete, which will obviously exceed the existing production capacity. Therefore, one of the top priorities for Ukrainian concrete plants today should be the implementation of a strategy and relevant development projects aimed at increasing productivity without losing quality. This research aims to create a simulation model of the production and delivery of ready-mixed concrete in a network of manufacturing plants and construction sites, as part of a project to create a digital double for making effective risk management decisions in real-time for the early detection of suboptimal activity in the production of high-quality concrete mix and its effective logis-tics. Thus, the objectives of the study are as follows: to analyze the problems and features of creating digital duplicates in the production and logistics of concrete plants; to develop a simulation model of analyzing pro-duction processes and logistics of ready-mixed concrete mixtures; to provide an illustrated example of model-ing production and logistics processes in a network of concrete factories and construction sites; to conduct op-timization experiments to determine the modes of system operation. After all necessary work had been done, the following results have been obtained. A simulation model of the analyzing production processes and logis-tics of ready-mixed concrete mixtures has been developed, with the help of which it is possible to solve several tasks, including the evaluation of the rationality and efficiency in the organization of production and delivery of ready-mixed concrete, the identification of bottlenecks in production and logistics processes, forecasting of indicators activities of concrete plants, taking into account changes in production conditions, and forming data for decision-making on reducing plant and customer downtime, among others. Conclusions.

Safety on construction sites is essential to avoid fatal accidents or damage to machinery. A fault-tolerant design is beneficial to safety because it allows necessary countermeasures to be taken in case of partial problems. However, one of the challenges is the consideration of delays caused by hydraulic characteristics, mechanisms, communications, and processing in outdoor construction machinery. Another difficulty is that collision detection with a safety margin to account for various delays may reduce work efficiency due to excessive detection. Therefore, we propose dual Digital Twin-based Collision Check (DTCC) systems to ensure safety without reducing work efficiency. The system ensures safety with two components. One is a detection function processed within the machine based on the current state to improve the certainty of stopping. The other is the ability to predict machine motion based on control inputs and intervene to prevent hazards. Through numerical experiments and verification using a real excavator, we confirmed that the combination of early deceleration by predictive detection and emergency stop can reliably stop the excavator without increasing the safety margin, demonstrating the practicality of the proposed method. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Autonomous excavators; Collisions avoidance; Construction sites; Fatal accidents; Fault-tolerant; Fault-tolerant designs; On-site detection; Real-time detection; Safety margin; Work efficiency; Excavators","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208272873"

A case study based on this process has been implemented for Tenement building in Hong Kong. Systematic modeling techniques were used to evaluate the damage to the tense building during the demolition process.

However, due to the complex dynamic construction environment and the uncertain installation process, few studies have been conducted on the pose and trajectory tracking of the module. The installation process of the modules lacks a reliable guidance system and relies almost entirely on the visual inspection and installation experience of the construction workers. Analyzing the hidden interactions and trajectories utilizing real-time spatio-temporal information of MiC assets has the potential to address the challenges of inaccurate module stacking. Therefore, in this paper, a Digital Twin (DT)-based pose estimation system with Transformer Network is proposed. Firstly, the information of workers, cranes, and 6-dimensional MiC module information is collected and updated by Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors for building DT virtual assets. Secondly, a DT framework incorporating the complex on-site environment is proposed to visualize the stacking process so as to guide the crane driver. Thirdly, a novel PoseFormer network is proposed as the backend of the DT framework to perform real-time pose estimation for the modules. Finally, the PoseFormer is compared with the current state-of-the-art deep learning model.

However, owing to variable boundary conditions among construction projects, acquiring segmented and labeled training data for time series analysis models requires extensive human effort at the early stages of each construction project, with limited data reusability. We propose a Dynamic Time Warping-based (DTW) ensemble model for segmenting and assigning labels, which are predefined by experts as reference labels, for repetitive construction process through classification, requiring only small amount of labeled training data. The model is validated through a case study involving the Kelly Drilling process in two construction projects, achieving an average accuracy close to 90%.

Numerous studies have employed the real-time locating system (RTLS) to identify crane load fall zones where crane loads may fall in the event of an accident. However, previous studies often assumed that the fall zone directly beneath the load was static and of a fixed size. In fact, the crane load fall zone is dynamic, varying with the movement of the crane jib and the geometric attribute of different crane loads. The dynamic identification of load fall zones to mitigate corresponding safety risks for on-site workers presents a complex challenge. In this paper, we design the RTLS-enabled digital twin for crane operation safety monitoring on construction sites for modular integrated construction (MiC). First, the improved algorithm is designed to dynamically identify the load fall zone associated with different prefabs. Second, we utilize an ultra-wideband (UWB) technology and time difference of arrival (TDoA) algorithm to pinpoint on-site workers in potential danger. Finally, safety warnings are provided to crane operators and onsite workers in potential danger zones to mitigate safety risks. Tests were conducted in a controlled laboratory environment to validate the proposed methodology. The results indicate that the system is effective in identifying dangerous zones, detecting worker proximity, and generating timely safety warnings, which can effectively mitigate safety risks on construction sites. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Fall detection; Ferroelectric RAM; Financial markets; Jib cranes; Construction sites; Crane loads; Crane operations; Fixed size; On-site workers; Operation safety; Real-Time Locating Systems; Safety concerns; Safety monitoring; Safety risks; Location","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208224994"

The natural periods of a building and hoist ropes in the building are usually close, causing resonance and a large response of the rope is induced. As a result, the rope catching can lead to the confinement of passengers in a car and long-term suspension of lift operation, which has a significant impact on the daily lives of the occupants or residents. To reduce such damage, it is important to estimate the response of the rope by seismic response analysis in advance and to clarify the conditions under which the response of the rope does not increase. On the other hand, in the field of information technology, the so-called digital twin method has recently been applied. The digital twin is a method of constructing objects that exist in real space in a virtual space and is useful for predicting damage by simulating events such as natural disasters. For rare events such as earthquakes, the application of the digital twin is a very effective method in terms of business continuity planning, evacuation planning and seismic reinforcement. Therefore, the authors’ research team is constructing an earthquake-disaster digital twin for residential buildings. The earthquake-disaster digital twin requires the construction of analytical models of the ground motion, buildings, furniture, etc., and the authors are constructing an analytical model of lifts, especially the ropes, which are frequently damaged. This paper presents an overview of the method and the results of a seismic response analysis.

One such domain is the architecture and construction, where the challenges related to efficient measurement, progress monitoring, maintenance, or verification of the agreement between a design and a built object, remain unsolved and may benefit from modern image and signal processing technology. Recognition of objects such as, e.g., walls, doors, or furniture in 3D scenes, allows the creation of so-called digital twins of the real-world environment. Within this study, we developed a series of deep learning models dedicated to semantic segmentation of point clouds representing interiors of buildings. Such representations are usually collected with expensive high-precision LiDAR scanners. The available neural network models, published in the literature, were, accordingly, trained using either such laser data or, alternatively, by the help of the synthetic ones. Our motivation was thus to enable semantic segmentation of RGBD point clouds acquired with a much cheaper sensor, i.e. a depth camera. In the absence of open real datasets, we propose to perform transfer learning and show that it is feasible to achieve reasonable segmentation accuracy on depth-camera data using a model pretrained on LiDAR scans. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","LiDAR scanning; semantic segmentation; transfer learning","Deep learning; Gluing; Network security; Neural network models; 3D scenes; Depth camera; Image processing technology; LiDAR scanning; Point-clouds; Real world environments; Recognition of objects; Semantic segmentation; Signal processing technologies; Transfer learning; Semantic Segmentation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207961724"

The study of pavement materials workability tests holds significant importance in terms of achieving well-mixed conditions with low-energy consumption. The complex components of the material and the uncertain kinematic behaviours of aggregates during mixing make this process challenging. And, few studies of the signal response of pavement materials have been found in the field of civil engineering. For this purpose, an accurate evaluation and monitoring approach for mixing are needed. In this paper, a wireless real-time sensing method is used to monitor the dynamic behaviour of aggregates during mixing.

From the concept to practice, the most dominant challenge could be the data management. Especially, the potentials of DTs in diverse application scenarios have been proposed from building to infrastructure, and to the city level under the requirements of multiple stakeholders. In this context, the data issues are aggravated facing the increasing heterogeneous data from the physical environment. However, there is limited research works examining and summarizing the data management issues when constructing DTs comprehensively in the AEC/FM sector. Therefore, this study aims to address this knowledge gap. First, a data environment with the enablers of data sources, data ecosystem, and data consumers connecting the physical and virtual spaces is defined. Specifically, the data ecosystem enabler is defined with five functional components (i.e., data collection and ingestion, data process and integration, data analysis and representation, data storage, and data pipelines). Then, 149 academic research works were selected as the data set for the systematic literature review. The review and analysis are conducted based on the structure of the enablers in a data environment.

Also, outcome-based policies are embraced in various industries, their potential impact on the construction sector has yet to be fully realized. Therefore, the potential of these concepts to mitigate the energy performance gap is explored in this paper. A brief state of the art review is presented. This is followed by the analysis of measured energy performance data of 143 office buildings awarded their ratings based on evidence of measured energy performance. Finally, frameworks for the implementation of these concepts to mitigate the energy performance gap in buildings are proposed.

This study aims to take initial steps toward such a digital twin concept using agent-based modelling and simulation. An agent-based model (ABM) was developed to simulate the real-time progress data from a construction site. Various data sources, i.e. Indoor positioning system (IPS), 360-degree camera videos and construction schedules were used to monitor the progress of the task. The ABM focused on the integration of IPS data directly into the model and simulating movement of the worker to reduce wasted effort and enhance productivity.

The idea behind developing such a topology is to have the response quite close to that from a real asset while keeping it computationally efficient. The aim is to develop an accurate and efficient model, akin to digital twins, which have the potential for real-time operation. Therefore the model is divided into two parts. One is a physics-based model that takes fundamental equations and motor construction parameters to yield an intermediate response. All the major parameters are taken into account such that the fundamental component comes quite close to that of the real asset and the bearing fault signature comes in the same order. These signatures are quite small and some small parasitic effects or the assumptions taken while simplifying the model might not impact the fundamental component that much but they alter the signature's amplitude quite significantly. One way is to model all the parasitic effects, which might increase the computation effort significantly. Another way is to take all the parasitic effects altogether and bridge the difference using a statistical approach which is developed using experimental data. Therefore, the current measurements were taken for several bearings with different fault severity. These measurements are processed and quantified such that the net outcome can express the evolution of the signature with increasing fault severity. The same is done for the data generated using the physics-based model. Finally, the difference in the responses is reduced using the neural network such that it can mimic real-world machine behavior closely. The analytical model followed by statistical adjustment overall is considered a hybrid model. The ultimate goal of this methodology is to generate extensive datasets encompassing diverse operating conditions that can be used further to estimate the health of the bearing and possibly be used for training predictive algorithms to estimate bearing RUL in motors. The proposed methodology is developed for the machine operating at 1000 & 1500 RPM and is validated for three different operating speeds. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","bearing faults; diagnostics; induction motor; motor current signature analysis","Asynchronous machinery; Bridge approaches; Traction motors; Bearing fault; Diagnostic; Fault severities; Fundamental component; Hybrid model; Induction machines; Inductions motors; Motor current signature analysis; Parasitics effects; Physics-based models; Bearings (machine parts)","Article","aip","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204681251"

Flexible load-leveling applications must accept more frequent and demanding start-stop cycles. Full transient analyses are too computationally expensive for real-time simulation across all operating regimes so monitoring relies on sparse physical measurements. Alone, these sparse data lack the fidelity for real-time prediction of a complex thermal field. A new hybrid methodology is proposed, coupling data across a range of fidelities to bridge the limitations in the individual analyses. Combining several fidelity methods in parallel: low-order models, corrected by real-time physical measurements, are calibrated with high-fidelity simulations. The multi-faceted hybrid approach enables the real-time speed of low-order analysis at high resolution. This paper series develops the critical enabling features of the hybrid method. Fast 3D thermal simulation is fundamental to the methodology. Low-order network models enable the real-time thermal calculation of regions inaccessible to monitoring and facilitate clearance and stress simulation necessary for flexible turbine operation. A novel automated construction method is presented, allowing complex full turbine thermal networks to be built with ease. Developed in Tensorflow, the thermal networks directly support GPU acceleration and neural network integration for seamless data transfer within the hybrid system.

Currently, necessary technological solutions that effectively tackle the inherent challenge of federating and integrating models and data that arises in these scenarios are however missing. Expanding upon the achievements of model-based engineering and its technological infrastructure, we propose a model repository for digital twins that tackles the models-meet-data challenge and establishes a technological basis for collaborative workflows.

To address this, the concept of Enterprise BIM is introduced with the aim of organizing BIM activities throughout the lifecycle in line with the organization's operational and strategic needs. The article explores the current industry practices of implementing Enterprise BIM for effective AM support. It focuses on Vestfold Health Trust and its award-winning hospital project in Toensberg, Norway, which was notable for its use of Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) and its attempts to adopt Enterprise BIM methodologies and solutions. Through literature studies and interviews with fifteen key personnel, the article provides recommendations for significant improvement within several AM areas, such as expertise, technology utilization, standardization, solving end-users' information needs, ontological adaptation, and associated IT solutions needs. The results highlight the limitations of using the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema and format for AM applications and suggest the development of flexible, searchable solutions based on ontologies and semantics to integrate sensor data into digital twins and asset information models. The study reveals a competency gap and deficiencies in information processes and IT solutions that organizations, along with the industry, must both address, emphasizing the use of international standards such as ISO 19650 to improve the integration of value chain considerations. Overall, this article provides valuable recommendations and a roadmap for the more strategic, holistic, and sustainable management of building information that aims to take into account and satisfy the end-user's information needs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asset Information Model; Asset Management; Building Information Modeling; Digital Twin; Enterprise Architecture; Enterprise BIM; Level of Information Need","Project management; Asset information model; Assets management; Building Information Modelling; End-users; Enterprise Architecture; Enterprise building information modeling; Information Modeling; Level of information need; User information need; Asset management","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201947889"

To address the challenges of low-latency synchronization, high computational overhead, and multidimensional resource scheduling faced by the vehicle digital twin (VDT) construction process within IoVs, we propose a construction scheme for variable granularity VDT. First, a variable granularity VDT construction framework for IoVs is proposed to reduce the communication pressure, edge load, and energy consumption in the network. Second, the VDT utility is quantified from four dimensions: 1) completeness; 2) accuracy; 3) timeliness; and 4) energy efficiency. Then, an optimization model is established with the goal of maximizing the average utility of the system VDT, which involves joint optimization of vehicle-edge association, VDT granularity setting and resource allocation. Due to the complexity of the optimization problem, it is decomposed into subproblems of vehicle-edge association, VDT granularity setting and resource allocation, and solved using matching theory and multiagent deep reinforcement learning, respectively. Finally, simulation results verify that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the utility of VDT in different simulation scenarios while reducing system resource consumption. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep reinforcement learning; digital twin (DT); Internet of Vehicles (IoVs); variable granularity","5G mobile communication systems; Advanced traffic management systems; Deep reinforcement learning; Information dissemination; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Reinforcement learning; Accuracy; Computational modelling; Digital twin; Internet of vehicle; Optimisations; Real - Time system; Reinforcement learnings; Resource management; Space vehicles; Variable granularity; Resource allocation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201773332"

Previous studies have shown that the Nigerian construction industry (NCI) is slow to adopt digital technologies and faces performance issues. As a result, this study aims to investigate and model the barriers to adopting digital twin (DT) technology in the NCI with the view to provide stakeholders with adequate information on the multifaceted nature of DT barriers and provide strategies to improve DT adoption. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a qualitative and quantitative approach to achieve the overall aim of the study. The qualitative approach included a scoping review used to identify barriers to DT adoption from the literature. A five-point Likert scale questionnaire was administered to 246 construction professionals in the NCI. This was followed by critical analysis using mean ranking and standard deviation, Kruskal–Wallis, factor analysis and partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The exploratory factor analysis revealed four categories of barriers to DT adoption in the NCI: “technological and investment”, “data management and government”, “project and human resources” and “digital transformation”. The PLS-SEM results revealed the causal relationships of four barriers categories and their concomitant effects on DT adoption in the NCI. The top three barrier categories that require critical attention in order of significance are: technological and investment (ß = 0.655), data management and government (ß = 0.313) and project and human resources (ß = 0.194). Digital transformation (ß = −0.046) has the least significance. Overall, all the barriers’ categories were accepted at a significance level of p < 0.05. Practical implications: The practical implications include guiding policymakers and practitioners in making informed decisions to address the identified barriers to DT adoption in the NCI. The findings may also be applicable to other developing countries in Africa and beyond. By implementing effective policies and stakeholder guidelines, the NCI can advance technologically and enhance its competitiveness to execute advanced construction projects. Originality/value: This research contributes to the construction industry by shedding light on the barriers to DT adoption and their intricate interconnections within the NCI context. It is also the first study in NCI context to present the level of DT awareness and explore the concomitant effects of the barriers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Barriers; Digital construction; Digital twin; Nigerian construction industry; Technological advancement; Technology adoption","Construction industry; Decision making; Human resource management; Investments; Project management; Barrier; Digital construction; Digital transformation; Factors analysis; Nigerian construction industry; Nigerians; Partial least-squares; Structural equation models; Technological advancement; Technology adoption; Information management","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201537384"

Through simulation, it could more intuitively reflect respiratory states and generate reliable respiratory data. The consistency of the digital twin of pulmonary ventilation was verified by the respiratory experiments. According to the verification results, the correlation coefficient and goodness of fit were 98.4% and 96.8%, respectively, in different respiratory patterns; 98.4% and 96.2%, respectively, in different examinees. It can be concluded that the digital twin of pulmonary ventilation could well mimic various respiratory patterns of different human bodies.

However, dynamic variations in network traffic and resource demands can lead to node overload and failures, necessitating timely virtual network function (VNF) migration to safeguard IoT business Quality of Service (QoS). Addressing the issue of deteriorating QoS due to untimely VNF migration, we propose a digital-twin (DT)-assisted VNF migration strategy based on resource demand prediction. First, a prediction model combining convolutional neural networks, gated recurrent units, and attention mechanisms is proposed to forecast VNF resource requirements. Second, the granularity of DT synchronization information is adjusted to resolve issues of delay and high cost during DT construction. Then, a VNF migration model is constructed to maximize DT utility while reducing network costs and average resource variance. Finally, a multiagent algorithm combining long short-term memory (LSTM) and double deep Q-network (DDQN) is proposed to perform VNF migration based on their priority-driven predicted future resource demands, and a multiagent algorithm based on dueling DDQN (D3QN) and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is proposed to address the DT association problem with a mixed action space. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the synchronization latency of the DT, the violation rate of service-level agreements, and the service outage time rate, while improving the network load balancing capability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin (DT); Internet of Things (IoT); network slicing (NS); resource allocation; virtual network function (VNF) migration","Forecasting; Internet of things; Long short-term memory; Multi agent systems; Network function virtualization; Resource allocation; Transfer functions; Network functions; Network slicing; Prediction algorithms; Quality-of-service; Resource demands; Resource management; Resources allocation; Virtual network function migration; Virtual networks; Quality of service","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200807674"

In this article, we proposed a monitoring algorithm for building updates based on satellite signals. We use satellite measurements to estimate the sky visibility from building blockages. By comparing it to the sky visibility from the existing data set, we can obtain the direction of the building being updated. Finally, the building update directions detected from multiple agents are collaborated in a crowd-sourcing manner to estimate the overall update probability of buildings. A simulation and a real experiment are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The proposed monitoring algorithm is robust to sky visibility estimation accuracy, number of agents, and agent positioning error from the simulation analysis.

Traditional monitoring methods, including both Simplified and Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (SEMS and PEMS, respectively) encounter practical and financial constraints when deployed extensively across the diverse machinery types. This paper introduces a novel approach on predicting emissions and fuel consumption by leveraging a priori recorded emissions data from non-road mobile machinery (NRMM) in a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) as part of a Digital Twin Platform (DTP). Focusing on three types of construction machines (drilling rig, loading excavator, and hauling dump truck) the DES models their basic operations on a DTP purposed for earthwork and foundation activities for a high-rise building project in Denmark. With the input of different configurations (e.g., machine quantity and type, location,), DES allows for the prediction of emissions and work output. Verification of the approach occurred in a field-realistic outdoor construction laboratory setting while the validation was demonstrated on a construction site. The results provide an efficient and economical avenue for monitoring emissions related to construction equipment operations.

This paper analyzes a case study in which a DT of a built bridge is developed during the particular episode of a load test, to understand how structural design can benefit (and potentially adapt) to the specific demands this innovative technology may generate. The bridge under twinning was already built and its design was neither determined nor influenced by the fact that load testing procedures were meant to be twinned. By identifying the link between the development of the DT of the bridge and its design, a conceptual diagram illustrates the key components to consider during the structural design phase. The main objective of this diagram is to present an encompassed vision of design that already accounts for the future existence of the DT of the asset, beyond the delivery of a BIM model. The implementation of the proposed diagram for the case study is described. As a result, it is observed that the proactive integration of structural engineers' specialized knowledge holds promise for enhancing the efficiency of DTs for construction and maintenance tasks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BIM; Digital Twins; FEM; IFC Sensor-based data; Structural Design","Architectural design; Bridges; Finite element method; Load testing; BIM; Case-studies; Developmental stage; IFC sensor-based data; Innovative technology; Paper analysis; Productivity enhancement; Sensor based data; Testing procedure; Work-flows; Structural design","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199665755"

Prevalent remote operation using multiple cameras cannot eliminate blind spots completely due to the limitation of the number of installable cameras. Thus, to ensure various remote operations can be performed safely, the 3D digital-twin system applying is developed. This system can help remote operators to recognize the location and behavior of remote-control machines in virtual space simulating a work site. Experiments using a crawler robot with a manipulator verify that remote operators can grip an object with the gripper of the manipulator while avoiding collision between the robot and the robot’s surrounding equipment. Furthermore, by using the system, remote operators can complement the field of view which camera images alone could not confirm. To apply the system in various work sites, the following research elements should be examined and verified. The first is to develop the collision-avoidance control with surrounding equipment for manipulators. The second is to improve the accuracy of self-localization and keep robots localized using 3D LiDAR. The third is to reflect the real behavior of objects in virtual space by using sensors such as LiDAR and stereo cameras. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Collision avoidance; Digital Twin; Remote Operation","Cameras; Manipulators; Optical radar; Remote control; Robots; Stereo image processing; Virtual reality; Blind spots; Camera images; Collisions avoidance; Field of views; Multiple cameras; Remote control operations; Remote operation; Remote operator; Virtual spaces; Work sites; Collision avoidance","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199664593"

Current data collection and processing methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and modern technologies, including robots and computer vision, offer a potential solution to this challenge. While past research has improved data collection and processing independently, a significant manual effort is still required to classify and transform collected data for processing. This research introduces the foundation of a novel framework to bridge this gap, leveraging an autonomous four-legged robot using the Software Development Kit (SDK) and the Robot Operation System (ROS). Additionally, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for navigating, and cloud computing platforms for data processing, are employed to establish a repository for raw data from images captured by the robot, facilitating simultaneous processing stages. The research proposes a cloud-based machine-learning service that hosts a deep-learning algorithm for material identification and quantification.

New training modes, such as Virtual Reality-based (VR) training simulators, have started to transform training in the construction industry. Although these new developments have been proven to be very effective, it is unanimously agreed by instructors that they do not substitute on-equipment training. During the on-equipment training, an instructor needs to monitor several novice trainees and provide feedback to ensure a safe learning environment. However, being outside the cabin, having to focus on multiple trainees at the same time, and having to stay at a safe distance, instructors are very susceptible to missing important details about the performance of the students. This oversight, in the long term, can result in the institutionalization of wrong behavior in the trainees, which is then very difficult to unlearn. In recent years, with the advent of cyber-physical systems and digital twins, it has become possible to support instructors by providing them with a digital replica of trainees’ operations. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there has been no systematic research on the use of digital twin as an education/training support tool in excavation training. To this end, this research proposes a comprehensive instructor support system that utilizes a digital twining approach to help instructors circumvent the limitations of traditional training. A prototype is used in a case study to indicate the potential of the proposed approach. It is shown that the proposed system offers great potential in supporting instructors to provide more in-depth feedback to the trainees. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Twin; Excavator; Support System; Training","Computer aided instruction; Construction equipment; Construction industry; E-learning; Embedded systems; Excavation; Excavators; Virtual reality; Construction operations; Cyber-physical systems; Equipment trainings; Institutionalisation; Learning environments; Performance; Safe distance; Support systems; Training mode; Training simulator; Personnel training","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199641892"

In the construction sector, DTs play a crucial role in building management, optimizing energy usage, predicting maintenance, and enhancing building lifecycle management. Although effectively integrated into traditional construction practices, its application in the prefabricated construction (PC) field remains relatively limited. Despite its potential to transform the PC, a significant research gap exists in comprehensive literature addressing the approaches, challenges, and requirements specific to this field. This study aims to bridge this gap through a mixed-method research approach that includes bibliometric analysis and systematic review. Publications related to PC and DT are collected from the Scopus database, followed by bibliometric analysis to offer a quantitative insight into the current research trends, prolific authors, and geographical distribution. Furthermore, this study conducts a systematic review that qualitatively analyzes the objectives of DT applications in PC, explores its methodological approaches, identifies challenges and recommendations for practitioners and researchers, and suggests future needs. The findings highlight the pressing need for standardization, robust data management, and scalable solutions to navigate the complexities. Conclusively, this paper presents a comprehensive conceptual framework to facilitate the application of DT in various phases of PC. The critical limitation is the reliance on the publications on the Scopus database and its potential biases. Excluding the need to expand on more emergent publications, discussing empirical DT studies in PC to highlight interoperability and standardization needs is also required for future research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Building Information Modeling; Cyber-Physical System; Digital Twins; Internet of Things; Prefabricated Construction","Construction; Construction industry; Embedded systems; Geographical distribution; Information management; Internet of things; Life cycle; Standardization; Bibliometrics analysis; Building Information Modelling; Construction approaches; Construction requirements; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Object systems; Physical objects; Scopus database; Systematic Review; Cyber Physical System","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199639704"

This paper presents an integrated framework that conceptualizes DT in construction projects as a sociotechnical system. This framework aims to address the social dynamics inherent in construction projects when implementing digital technologies. The proposed framework is developed as an amalgamation of components from existing DT and socio-technical systems to enable simultaneous focus on technical requirements and social readiness. It represents different DT maturity stages spanning from static digital models to fully functional DT with bi-directional data flow. These stages are mapped against the dimensions of a socio-technical system including goals, people, technology, processes, infrastructure, and culture. The findings of this study can serve as a research roadmap for creating a comprehensive approach for DT implementation in the construction industry. This approach can ultimately evolve into a DT execution plan (DTEP), which can be requested by clients and as an addendum to contracts in the future. Future work involves validating the framework and benchmarking it against established frameworks in other industries. Additionally, the framework can be extended to incorporate external factors such as policy, legal, and commercial factors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twins; implementation frameworks; Socio-technical systems","Architectural design; Data flow analysis; Data transfer; Building Information Modelling; Construction projects; Construction sectors; Dataflow; Digital environment; Implementation framework; Integrated frameworks; Physical environments; Social dynamics; Sociotechnical systems; Construction industry","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199596693"

This is especially true for prefabricated construction for either new buildings or envelope retrofits. Here, prefabricated components are manufactured offsite according to design specifications and installed onsite. Accurate information on the component’s position and orientation (pose) is needed to achieve this. A tool named “Real-Time Evaluator” (RTE), designed to autonomously track prefabricated components as they are being installed and provide real-time installation instructions, is currently under development using a single robotic total station. This is challenging since at least three points are needed to determine the pose of an object in space. To achieve this goal with a single robotic total station, two key algorithms were developed: (1) the “resection” algorithm aligns the digital twin with the physical twin regardless of the location of the total station, and (2) the “transformation” algorithm gives instructions of translations and rotations to installers to achieve the desired installation pose. The algorithms were evaluated experimentally on a lab-scale demonstration. Results show that the resection algorithm achieved an average error of < 3.1 mm, while the transformation algorithm predicted the rotation angle along a single axis with an error of < 0.5◦ © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accuracy; Automation; Prefabricated construction; Resection; Rotation","Construction; Construction industry; Robotics; Accuracy; Automation in construction; Building envelopes; Construction process; Prefabricated components; Real- time; Resection; Robotic total station; Time cost; Transformation algorithm; Wages","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199588829"

The target building is a net-positive energy building, where all sensor and operational data is integrated into a centralized data repository, otherwise known as a data lake. This data serves as the input to a BEM that can not only model building performance, but also interface with the BAS system to optimize building operation on a system level scale. However, the ability to collect, store, and query data alone is insufficient to establish a successful system, as poor data quality can lead to inaccurate model output and ineffective building control. While there exist documented efforts and standards, there is a lack of literature addressing post-construction data system management. Yet we have consistently found that data acquisition must be complemented by robust measures to ensure data usability, which includes actively tracking sensor performance, data quality, and key building performance metrics to ensure the integrity of the collected data. This paper outlines a data validation framework that uses equipment and correlation groupings to enable the usage of both physics-based and data-driven models. This hybrid approach makes it possible to not only perform sensor data validation and reconstruction, but also monitor equipment performance and sensor degradation. By employing these strategies and tools, we aim to enhance the feasibility and effectiveness of BEM and BAS interoperability, ultimately improving building control and management in real-world applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Automation; Data acquisition; Intelligent buildings; Interoperability; Lakes; Quality control; Search engines; Building automation systems; Building controls; Building energy model; Building performance; Control and management; Data quality; Management frameworks; Modeling automation; Real-world; Systems interoperability; Information management","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198942945"

Digital Twin (DT) is envisioned as an efficient method for designing 6G that migrates the behaviors of physical nodes to the virtual space. However, in the high-dynamic 6G network, there still exist challenges in achieving accuracy and flexibility when constructing DT. In this article, we propose a Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI)-driven mobile network digital twin paradigm, where the GAI is utilized as a key enabler to generate DT data. Specifically, GAI is capable of implicitly learning the complex distribution of network data, allowing it to sample from the distribution and obtain high-fidelity data. In addition, the construction of DT is closely related to various types of data, such as environmental, user, and service data. GAI can utilize these data as conditions to control the generation process under different scenarios, thereby enhancing flexibility. In practice, we develop a network digital twin prototype system to accurately model the behaviors of mobile network elements (i.e., mobile users, base stations, and wireless environments) and to evaluate network performance. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed prototype system can generate high-fidelity DT data and provide practical network optimization solutions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","generative AI; Network digital twin; network optimization","Wireless networks; Dynamic contexts; Generative AI; Global coverage; High-fidelity; Network design; Network digital twin; Network optimization; Physical nodes; Prototype system; Service requirements; Mobile telecommunication systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197081544"

Established certification standards such as CFR-25 and MIL-HDBK-516 require considerable subjective analysis to transform the certification requirements into meaningful actionable requirements. This prevents the automation of any verification, assurance and certification task. While established methods rely on automation of assurance case generation, several key tasks that still requires human input preventing the co-creation of designs, verification scenarios, evidences, and assurance cases. Building on the recent success of large language models, we develop a framework that enables the automated verification and assurance of cyber-physical systems. Our framework consists of two parts – (i) an automated pipeline permits the automatic extraction of information from system artifacts such that a they can be semantically linked using a graphical representation; and (ii) an automated pipeline that enables the synthesis of verification scenarios to co-generate evidence along with the assurance case of the cyber-physical systems. We demonstrate our framework on a concrete example of a landing gear sub-system of the aircraft and highlight the benefits that can be realized through the automation of the bottlenecks in the task of verification, assurance, and certification.

This case study is an excellent example of the potential and real-world advantages of using cutting-edge technologies in industrial settings. This study delves into the challenge of failure prediction in process sectors that use intelligent and autonomous cyber-physical systems (CPS) in a 6G setting. This aligns with the latest developments in Industry 4.0 and the IIoT. Specifically, we developed a full-stack deep learning approach that used massive amounts of real-time sensory data collected from wireless sensors in a chemical plant. To start, while working with unbalanced time-series data, a unique recursive architecture is proposed that uses several lookback inputs to make an initial forecast using autoregression. During this method, a new learning algorithm called ""Recursive Gradient Descent (RGD)"" is developed for the proposed architecture to reduce the cumulative prediction uncertainties. Afterwards, a multi-class classification model using temporal convolutions across many channels with a decay effect is proposed to detect and localise the root causes of failure. Because of its exceptional ability to reduce prediction uncertainties accumulated across numerous prediction stages, the entire network is termed the Cumulative Uncertainty Reduction Network with Bayesian Neural Network (CURN-BNN).

However, the warm-up phase is usually omitted, which can also have an influence on the behavior of BSFDS. The dynamical behavior of BSFDS in the warm-up phase is influenced by temperature and hence difficult to be described by a linear time invariant model.

As structures are often built based on design conditions that may no longer align with their current capacity, there is a need to ensure their preservation and meet modern requirements. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has emerged as a valuable solution to addressing these challenges. By utilizing BIM, a technology and methodology that enables comprehensive digital representation of the infra-structure, designers have now the capability to easily identify and mitigate critical points from the early stages of design by using a best practice engineering approach and clash detection technology. In a specific case study, ETS has undertaken the responsibility for conducting the rehabilitation of a disused tunnel with masonry lining in a harbour area. The intervention is within the framework of the connection between the historic harbour of Genoa (Parco Rugna/Bettolo) and Bivio Fegino. The design process has been carried out with digital strategies for infrastructure maintenance that are very fast and minimally invasive. A new tunnel modelling and design solution, OpenTunnel Designer, has been utilized to digitally model and analyze the existing tunnels. Starting from the digital geometric survey, it becomes feasible to generate precise digital replicas of actual structures.

To achieve this goal, the future wireless communication system should provide high quality communication service with ultra-high capacity and reliability, ultra-low latency, and so on. As one of the key technologies to achieve the Metaverse, Digital Twin Network (DTN) is applied to improve the network performance by dynamically mapping the virtual and real wireless system in real-time throughout its lifecycle, but the construction and evolution of the digital twin (DT) models highly depend on real-time sensing data from the physical world. In addition, the Metaverse is not only a high-precision replica of the real world, but also consists of some exploration things extending from the real world to enrich the users' experience.

To this end, this paper aims to depict a novel path to achieve the intelligent Metaverse. First, the frontier capabilities and key elements of AIGC are presented.

As a unique feature of HDT, we consider that PTs' corresponding VTs are deployed on edge servers, consisting of not only generic models placed by downloading experiential knowledge from the cloud but also customized models updated by collecting personalized data from end devices.

The purpose of the conducted research is to analyze the possibilities provided by the “digital city” system and the prospects for the application of nanotechnologies. The objective of the research is to determine the possibility of digitalization in city management and the process of making more substantiated decisions regarding real estate operation. The practical application opportunities of the research results are due to the feasibility of implementing the author's approach to analyzing the operation of urban systems in general and “smart home” in particular. Methods and materials. The article explores the concept of “digital twin of a building,” its functions, components, features of construction and operation using digital twin technologies. The concept of digitalization is characterized, as well as mechanisms for introducing innovations into urban life. It is demonstrated that the “digital city” incorporates various innovative technologies: Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, data analytics, cloud computing, etc. The technologies utilized by the “digital city"" not only collect data on urban life but also employ obtained data for managing electricity supply, waste collection, ensuring people's safety, and as elucidated in the article, transportation systems. Discussion. Digitization in urban management helps to create a more convenient and sustainable urban environment, a goal pursued by the governments of many countries. The implementation of sensors, detectors, and the analysis of data obtained from them provides an opportunity to improve the quality of life for urban residents and increase the efficiency of resource utilization. As a pleasant “bonus,” all of this allows making the living environment of citizens more environmentally friendly, addressing an issue that has been a “headache” for many governments – the issue of greening human existence in the city. After all, reducing the number of traffic jams automatically reduces the amount of carbon dioxide emissions, and turning on city lighting based on sensor signals saves electricity due to a reduction of consumed kilowatts since the bulbs are not unnecessarily lit. To address these issues, the use of nanotechnologies is proposed, which will enable ordinary building materials to acquire new unique properties. The emergence of nanotechnologies and their application can solve the problem of energy conservation in the construction industry. Moreover, nanotechnologies not only allow for the production of new products with unique properties but also enhance the efficiency of materials used in construction. In this regard, the key question for determining the application of nanotechnologies is the exploration of their integration into the digitization system of city management, which already incorporates a multitude of innovations and new technologies that help optimize the work of municipal services and improve the quality of life for urban residents. Conclusions. The author concludes that the provision of services by many urban services is based on 3D design technologies, as well as data collected within the framework of the “digital city” system. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; building; digital twin of a building; digitization; virtual copy; “digital city”","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194137179"

However, it is notably susceptible to vulnerabilities, particularly buffer overflows that are ranked among the most dangerous due to their potential for catastrophic consequences. Traditional techniques, such as static analysis, often struggle with scalability and precision when detecting these vulnerabilities in the binary code of compiled C programs. This paper introduces a novel approach designed to overcome these limitations by leveraging model checking techniques to verify security properties within a program’s stack memory. To verify these properties, we propose the construction of a state space of the stack memory from a binary program’s control flow graph. Security properties, modelled for stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities and defined in Linear Temporal Logic, are verified against this state space. When violations are detected, counter-example traces are generated to undergo a reverse-flow analysis process to identify specific instances of stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

Operator productivity and safety are therefore critical in the construction industry. The advancements in technologies such as digitization and automation are more and more applied in the industry, leading to more data and knowledge on the construction equipment and environment. This can be leveraged by a digital twin to provide value for the operator. In this work, we present a digital twin architecture applied to an off highway vehicle, which provides real-time feedback to the operator while operating the vehicle. Monitoring the interactions between an off highway vehicle and workers will result in a safer and more productive environment. This work focuses on detection of the environment and monitoring the state of the vehicle.

Using Digital Twins (DTs) can aid in making O&M more effective and efficient, leading to time and cost savings. The concept of DT started in the Aerospace domain, and other industries eventually adopted it. DTs are a new concept to the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations (AECO) Industry, and there is a lot of confusion around this concept. The purpose of this paper is to provide a DT definition along with a classification structure to create a common ground for understanding DTs in the AECO industry, which leads to easier adoption of DTs. A systematic literature review was completed to identify the existing DT definitions and classification approaches. Then, through a content analysis, the core components of definitions were extracted. The identified components were used to develop a comprehensive and inclusive DT definition for the AECO industry, using the domain language. In a similar fashion, existing DT classification structures were studied, and their components were identified through content analysis. Using the identified components, a DT classification structure was proposed for the AECO industry using domain concepts and terms. The results were validated and refined through a series of semi-structured expert interviews and surveys. Interviewees and survey participants comprised DT experts from academia and industry with diverse backgrounds. The components of the proposed DT definition include virtual representation, data connection between physical and digital entities, analysis, actuation, and frequency of updates. The classification structure consisted of three DT categories, namely Digital Twin Prototype (DTP), Digital Shadow (DS), and Cyber-Physical System (CPS). © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AECO; Classification System; Common Data Environment; Cyber-Physical Systems; Digital Shadows; Digital Twins; Information Management","Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Life cycle; Architecture engineering; Architecture, engineering, construction, and operation; Classification system; Common data environment; Common datum; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Data environment; Digital shadow; Engineering constructions; Engineering operation; Information management","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189706314"

An enterprise e-profile is enterprise model data that describes an enterprise's outline, characteristics, dynamic activity as behavior, etc. in a common understandable manner. An enterprise e-profile can be converted into a virtual enterprise (software agent) as a member of a network. When configuring a business-to-business collaborative network in cyberspace, by constructing a virtual network as a multi-agent system, it is possible to search the appropriate cooperation partner, to consider the appropriate action of oneself and so on. In other words, an enterprise e-profile will act as name card of the company in the cyber business world.

Using data and models, digital twins are capable of doing monitoring, modelling, prediction, optimization, and other activities. Digital twin modelling, in particular, is the key to correctly characterizing actual things, enabling digital twins to provide functional services, and meeting application requirements. In this work, a platform for supervising the building of tunnels using digital twins is suggested. Traditional tunnel construction management calls for skilled managers to conduct on-site inspections and recording, which takes time away from other crucial jobs and makes it easy for errors to occur due to the intricacy of the engineering. The digital twin visualization platform for tunnel construction can perform accurate real-time inspection, monitoring, and management of the construction process as well as complete overall management of the entire construction process when used in conjunction with other technologies like the Internet of Things, GNSS technology, 3D modeling, and others.

DT offers a wide range of applications throughout the building development process. However, some specific factors impede its widespread adoption in the building industry. This study aims to systematically review the available literature on the building project development process from the perspective of DT, with a particular focus on predictive simulations, i.e., co-sims. The review provides a comprehensive overview of drivers and barriers to DT adoption through an analysis of 147 studies between 2013 and 2023. The research identifies seven external and 41 internal drivers, including efficient project management and monitoring, predictive maintenance, and the collection and visualization of real-time data, all of which contribute to improved decision-making processes and reduced operational expenses. Further, the study identifies nine external and 31 internal barriers that impede the adoption of DT in the building development process. These barriers encompass challenges such as a high initial investment cost, a scarcity of a skilled workforce, difficulties in data interoperability, and resistance to change within the organization. A key outcome of the literature review is having identified the opportunity to exploit technologies developed in the automotive sector that enable a seamless integration of specialized simulator models in building development processes, resulting in collaborative simulations. Thus, we propose the concept of a Building Simulation Identity Card (BSIC) to be pursued in future research that would enable stakeholders to address the challenges of collaboration, cooperation, coordination, and communication by creating a common vocabulary to effectively facilitate the adoption of DT in the building's development process. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Building Information Modeling; Building Simulation Identity Card (BSIC); Collaborative Simulations; Digital Twin; Lifecycle Data; Model Identity Card; Simulators","Automotive industry; Buildings; Construction industry; Data visualization; Life cycle; Project management; Building development; Building Information Modelling; Building simulation; Building simulation identity card; Collaborative simulation; Development process; Identity cards; Lifecycle data; Model identity card; Decision making","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189373648"

Existing RoboAvatars are described in data schemas predominantly from the robotics community, which prevents their smooth applications in the built environment. To fully unleash the power of robotics, this research aims to develop a Building RoboAvatar by adopting the industry foundation classes (IFC) as the de facto standard in the building industry. First, the Building RoboAvatar is defined from a built environment perspective, and then substantiated with IFC. A translator called RoboIFCTrans is developed to facilitate the exploitation of the numerous readily available RoboAvatars represented by the Unified Robot Description Format. Experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of Building RoboAvatar in representing robot information needed for the built environment, which encompasses the ""whole-part""robot structure and properties in terms of productivity, capability, etc. The RoboIFCTrans can accurately generate IFC representations of diverse robots (TurtleBot, UR-5, Diablo) within 41.9 s. Practical implications of the IFC-based Building RoboAvatars were illustrated by two use cases. The research contributes to building a ""Tower of Babel""between the construction and robotics communities.

With the recent advances in mixed reality (MR) and reality capture technologies, a new interface for teleoperating robots with a physical world reference is made possible. This paper introduces an intuitive MR control interface that could mitigate the gap between humans and robots by using a HoloLens2 optical see-through head mounted display (HMD), a Franka Panda 7-DOF robot arm, ranging sensors, and Unity game engine. With real-time acquired spatial information, a high-fidelity digital twin of the physical workspace is teleported to the user in mixed reality. Simultaneously, a virtual space around the user is also defined by the HMD with their hand gesture processed as input commands. The two virtualized spaces are then registered together and merged to be organized by the Unity game engine.

This paper intends to review DT cases in construction to help DT adopters understand DT-enabling technologies based on the maturity level of their demanded DT. The outcome of this study provides DT adopters with practical insights into how to decide the DT maturity level that meets their demand and what are the enabling technologies that support their DT development.

Digital twins are used in infrastructure, industrial machinery, urban planning, and healthcare. This study introduced SA-GSA-based session key creation. This research suggests using the Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) and Self Adaptive (SA) methods to efficiently choose the session key. Due to the hybrid approach, key creation is secure and optimal for each domain and device. The hybrid algorithm continually evaluates security and adjusts key generation settings to counter new attacks. The hybrid SA-GSA method boosts system performance by efficiently allocating resources and validating transactions.

The t/k-diagnosis strategy, as a strong and adaptive self-diagnosis strategy, is an important part for ensuring endogenous security. Moreover, the folded hypercube (FQ<inf>n</inf>) as a data transmission network (e.g., optical network) topology offers new potential for the construction of large-scale, high data throughput, and low-latency systems, such as computing network, human-cyber-physical systems, and smart grid. However, there are few studies on endogenous security based on FQ<inf>n</inf> networks. Therefore, this article designs an adaptive system-level fault self-diagnosis strategy, namely Fast t/k-Diagnosis Under Maeng-Malek Model (Ftk-DIAG-MM*) to diagnosis the faulty vertices in FQ<inf>n</inf> network under the Maeng-Malek model (MM∗ mod). Then, we provide a proof of the algorithm correctness theoretically by the fault tolerance of FQ<inf>n</inf> network. It is derived by theoretical derivation that the t/k-diagnosability inherent to the FQ<inf>n</inf> network is (n+1)(k+1)-k(k+3)/2. The simulation experiments demonstrate that the designed Ftk-DIAG-MM∗ strategy can correctly diagnose all vertices within the range allowed by the diagnosability, and still has a great performance when it exceeds the range allowed by the diagnosability. It greatly enhances the fault diagnosis capability of FQ<inf>n</inf> network in the circumstance of misdiagnosing a few vertices, which provides an important theoretical basis for the reliability and endogenous security of FQ<inf>n</inf> networks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","endogenous security; fault self-diagnosis; folded hypercube; reliability; t/k-Diagnosability","Electronic mail; Embedded systems; Fault detection; Fault tolerance; Fault tolerant computer systems; Geometry; Network architecture; Network security; Diagnosability; Diagnosis strategies; Endogenous security; Fault self-diagnosis; Faults diagnosis; Folded hypercubes; Hyper-cubes; Networks security; Security; T/k-diagnosability; Topology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184819240"

A digital twin is a digital, intelligent counterpart of a real-life object, human, process, or building, which is uniquely linked to its physical twin, establishing a one-to-one correspondence between them. Construction projects involve a huge amount of information creation and sharing among the project team. Hence, a large amount of data is generated in each project which needs to be created, analyzed, and made accessible to everyone working on the same building. A digital twin offers additional value over the use of building information models (BIM) to manage the construction process because of its potential to update using real-time progress and simulate forecasted conditions. Unlike digital twins in manufacturing, digital twins for construction are still poorly understood. The temporary nature of construction and the dynamic nature of the sites make monitoring of construction processes and resources difficult. To address this issue, this paper explores the use of digital twins in construction processes. It discusses the use cases of digital twins and their potential application in construction contexts. It is observed that sequencing tasks/processes, navigation, forecasting, and setting up data-enriched 3D models to simulate construction processes can all be potentially mirrored using digital twins with more innovations in existing technology in construction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Architectural design; Information theory; Amount of information; Building Information Modelling; Construction process; Construction projects; Information creation; Information sharing; Large amounts of data; Literature overview; Literature reviews; Project team; Construction","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184287238"

Delayed delivery of elements from prefabricated plants would postpone the construction progress, resulting in economic losses, disputes, and change orders. To certify these works transparently and precisely, a tamperproof digital asset tracking system is important. Blockchain can be the potential solution due to the immutability and trustworthiness of its record, while building information modeling (BIM)-based digital twins can provide rich semantic information on building assets. However, current studies have not achieved sufficient collaboration for automatic asset tracking and change visualization. To address the limitation, this paper proposes an integrated BIM-based blockchain framework based on smart contracts. First, assets and their semantic information, as well as construction schedule with the dependency among their relevant activities, are automatically transmitted from BIM to the blockchain, where corresponding QR codes are generated to attach physical assets. As their physical tracking data are updated in the blockchain, if any delay, the potential changes will be automatically propagated to all affected activities by executing compiled smart contracts. Once stakeholders certify these changes, the affected activities with corresponding assets are automatically visualized in the 4D environment for timely notification and collaboration. We also develop a prototype system to validate this framework's feasibility in a trusted and traceable way. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Architectural design; Blockchain; Losses; Modular construction; Project management; Semantics; Smart contract; Visualization; Asset tracking; Block-chain; Building Information Modelling; Construction progress; Construction projects; Economic loss; Model-based OPC; Off-site construction; On-site construction; Semantics Information; Information theory","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184285482"

A significant challenge of robot teleoperation is the disconnection between the robotic perception and the human operator's sensory processes, creating a sensorimotor mismatch in motor-intensive activities. As a result, recent robot teleoperation literature has started investigating haptic interactions in the feedback and control loop. Haptics, including the feeling of force, motion, and vibrations, have been proven helpful for accurately perceiving task status and physical systems with heavy motions and enabling precision operations. However, the current haptic simulation methods are oversimplified and hard to provide a comprehensive, realistic, and complete simulation of the physical interaction that occurs in typical construction operations. This study aims to test a comprehensive, high-fidelity physical rendering method that simulates complete real-world physical processes via the physics engine. The proposed method captures all categories of physical interaction in typical motor-intensive construction tasks, including weight force, texture force, inertia force, and impact force. The result shows that the proposed method builds a digital twin model of real physical processes to facilitate intuitive robot teleoperation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Remote control; Robots; Sensory perception; Augmentation systems; Construction applications; Construction robots; Haptics; Human operator; Physical interactions; Physical process; Robot teleoperation; Sensorimotors; Sensory process; Textures","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184283972"

As a response, there has been active research on automated safety planning approaches. With the emergence of digital twins and the increased temporal resolution of updates on the status of a construction site, automated approaches for safety analysis will be necessary to exploit this increasing quantity of data. Nevertheless, creating a digital representation of the construction site and performing safety planning is computationally complex and intensive. It is not feasible to re-compute the safety assessment of the entire construction situation from scratch for every change that occurs. This work presents a novel approach to capture incremental localized changes happening in the construction situation, that is, when one or more elements are constructed, but the rest of the site remains unchanged. The changes are captured in a graph-based structure where the affected safety elements can efficiently and rapidly be extracted, facilitating a targeted re-computation. This work also demonstrates other benefits of the graph, such as improved decision support for construction planning. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Automation; Decision support systems; Automated approach; Automated construction; Construction safety; Construction sites; Design and planning; Graph-based; Labour-intensive; Safety planning; Spatial computations; Temporal resolution; Graphic methods","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184114368"

However, the construction industry has been slow to adopt DT, lagging behind sectors such as manufacturing and medicine, where digitalization has made significant strides. Given the demonstrated benefits and potential of DT, it is crucial to increase research efforts for enhancing its application in the construction industry. To accurately identify prospective areas for future research, a comprehensive review and analysis of the status quo of relevant research is urgently needed. This study undertook a systematic literature review to understand how DT can enhance operational intelligence in the building construction industry. The findings, based on a review of pertinent literature, revealed that existing studies predominantly focused on the application of DT during the construction phase and the operation and maintenance phase. However, its potential use during the planning and design phase and the demolition and recovery phase was largely overlooked. Three main categories of key digital facilitating technologies for DT in the building construction industry have been identified: (1) data-related technologies; (2) high-fidelity modeling technologies; and (3) model-based simulation technologies. These technologies have finally culminated into an integrative framework. Furthermore, three significant research gaps in the application of DT in the building construction industry have been identified, suggesting future studies explore how to (1) centralize diverse stakeholders from a lifecycle perspective; (2) address various existing technological defects; and (3) establish a universal industry standard. This paper provides a valuable roadmap for relevant stakeholders to understand the status quo of DT application and the existing deficiencies in its full implementation, which should facilitate the efficient digitalization of the construction industry. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","A lifecycle perspective; An integrative framework; Building construction industry; Digital twin; Systematic literature review","Buildings; Construction; Life cycle; A lifecycle perspective; An integrative framework; Building construction industry; Industrial sector; Integrative framework; ITS applications; Prospectives; Research efforts; Status quo; Systematic literature review; Construction industry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183605156"

Surprisingly, the degradation of aging-induced lifting capacity (LC) remains an unexplored domain. In response to this research gap, this paper introduces a digital twin-driven (DTD) framework and model to predict the degraded LC of aging tower cranes. This framework combines theoretical and numerical analysis of fatigue and degradation behavior in tower cranes with real-time vibration data obtained during cyclic load scenarios on the actual cranes. Machine learning (ML) techniques are employed to develop a model that accurately predicts the degraded LC caused by aging. A scaled-down tower crane prototype is adopted as a demonstrative case to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the DTD framework. The DTD model predicts the degraded LC of the prototype with high accuracy, achieving a mean-square error (MSE) of 0.2253 and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9973. The predicted degraded load charts of the tested tower crane for each decade of usage from 0 to 70 years are also presented to assist crane operators in applying safe loads, preventing unexpected failures and damages, and enhancing workplace monitoring and safety. This study helps monitor the safety conditions of tower cranes that are aging and susceptible to structural fatigue and deterioration, facilitates the prediction of the deterioration of complex machines and systems in the construction industry with real-time data, and highlights the potential of DTD approaches in improving efficiency, safety, and decision-making. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin; IoT system; Lifting capacity; Safety monitoring; Tower crane","Accident prevention; Construction industry; Decision making; Deterioration; Fatigue of materials; Mean square error; Real time systems; Tower cranes; Towers; Vibration analysis; Degradation behavior; Fatigue behaviour; IoT system; Lifting capacity; Real-time vibration data; Research gaps; Risk of failure; Safety monitoring; Structural deterioration; Structural fatigue; Forecasting","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183590095"

By integrating and coordinating the operation of these robotic devices, it is possible to achieve collaborative multitasking and autonomous operations in various environments. In the field of surveying and mapping, the traditional single-type unmanned device data collection mode is no longer sufficient to meet the data acquisition tasks in complex spatial scenarios (such as low-altitude, surface, indoor, underground, etc.). Faced with the data collection requirements in complex spaces, employing different types of robots for collaborative operations is an important means to improve operational efficiency. Additionally, the limited computational and storage capabilities of unmanned systems themselves pose significant challenges to multi-unmanned systems. Therefore, this paper designs an edge–end–cloud integrated multi-unmanned system payload management and computing platform (IMUC) that combines edge, end, and cloud computing. By utilizing the immense computational power and storage resources of the cloud, the platform enables cloud-based online task management and data acquisition visualization for multi-unmanned systems. The platform addresses the high complexity of task execution in various scenarios by considering factors such as space, time, and task completion. It performs data collection tasks at the end terminal, optimizes processing at the edge, and finally transmits the data to the cloud for visualization. The platform seamlessly integrates edge computing, terminal devices, and cloud resources, achieving efficient resource utilization and distributed execution of computing tasks. Test results demonstrate that the platform can successfully complete the entire process of payload management and computation for multi-unmanned systems in complex scenarios. The platform exhibits low response time and produces normal routing results, greatly enhancing operational efficiency in the field. These test results validate the practicality and reliability of the platform, providing a new approach for efficient operations of multi-unmanned systems in surveying and mapping requirements, combining cloud computing with the construction of smart cities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cloud platform; digital twins; edge–device–cloud integration; multi-machine collaboration; multi-unmanned systems; payload management","Collaborative robots; Edge computing; Ferroelectric RAM; Intelligent robots; Multipurpose robots; Network security; Cloud integrations; Cloud platforms; Data collection; Edge–device–cloud integration; Management platforms; Multi-machine collaboration; Multi-machines; Multi-unmanned system; Payload management; Unmanned system","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183103936"

Meanwhile, for performance analysis under variable operating conditions during the product design and operation phase, digital simulation also has the above problems. Therefore, based on the method for variable product structures proposed in Part 1, a product performance rapid simulation approach driven by DT data for variable operating conditions is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the framework for variable operating conditions is designed based on the makeTwin reference architecture, including twin source data acquisition for the product under different operating conditions, twin data-driven product performance rapid simulation model (RSM) construction for variable operating conditions, and rapid evaluation of product critical performance based on RSM.

Digital twin (DT) can solve the above problems in piling construction because of their inherent three-dimensionality and real-time feedback. The present study proposes a system that utilizes the DT framework to construct a collision early warning system intended for marine piling. A five-dimensional model is used to introduce the overall architecture. The main twin objects are piles. To maximize the effectiveness of DT, the five-dimensional model is composed of four independently maintainable development modules. Consequently, a prototype of the system is created. The core of the system comprises an algorithm for pile positioning and an algorithm for collision early warning, especially for complex pile groups. Two distinct implementations are identified: one involves controlling the virtual with the real, while the other involves controlling the real with the virtual. Field experiments are conducted with the aim of establishing a benchmark for collision early warning during the construction process. The prototype of the system is capable of producing a simulated environment through a dual-layer mapping approach, which involves pile-boat mapping and early-warning feedback mapping. The presented system in a practical wharf project showcases both the capacity for three-dimensional visualization of collision warning and the ability to provide feedback for boat control. The research enables more intuitive and effective pile positioning. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Collision early warning; Digital twin; Marine piling; Pile positioning; System development","Boats; Feedback; Hydraulic structures; Mapping; Three dimensional computer graphics; Collision early warning; Dimensional model; Early warning; Early Warning System; Marine piling; Pile position; Pile positioning; Real-time feedback; Spatial informations; System development; Piles","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178213625"

We proposed to use a one-way function (OWF) chain structure to build an efficient proof of aliveness, such that the prover sends every node on the OWF chain in a reverse order periodically. However, the finite nodes in OWF chains limited its practicality. We enhance our first PoA construction by linking multiple OWF chains together using a pseudo-random generator chain in our second PoA scheme. This enhancement allows us to integrate one-time signature (OTS) schemes into the structure of the second construction to realize the auto-replenishment of the aliveness proofs for continuous use without interruption for reinitialization. In this work, our primary motivation is to further improve our secondary PoA and auto-replenishment schemes. Instead of storing the tail nodes of multiple OWF chains on the verifier side, we use a Bloom Filter to compress them, reducing the storage cost by 4.74.7 times. Moreover, the OTS-based auto-replenishment solution cannot be applied to our first scheme, and it is not so efficient despite its standard model security. To overcome these limitations, we design a new auto-replenishment scheme from a hash-based commitment under the random oracle model in this work, which is much faster and can be used by both PoA schemes. Considering the implementation on a storage/memory-constrained device, we particularly study the strategies for efficiently generating proofs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Authentication; auto replenishment; CPS security; cyber-physical systems; one-time passwords; one-way functions; proof of aliveness","Cryptography; Cyber Physical System; Cybersecurity; Electronic mail; Embedded systems; Auto replenishment; CPS security; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Generator; One-time password; One-way functions; Password; Proof of aliveness; Tail; Authentication","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178062921"

Existing approaches primarily focus on identifying the immediate incidents of unsafe events, often neglecting the latent risks arising from the high uncertainty of agents’ motions. To bridge this gap and lay the basis for preemptive risk monitoring, this paper proposes a novel and effective digital twin-based motion forecasting framework that leverages cloud-edge collaboration to predict the future trajectories of workers on construction sites, while ensuring data privacy and reducing computational burden. The edge-end acquires multi-view images about the physical scene and extracts multi-scale features with a deep learning-based backbone. In the cloud-end, where the digital world is hosted, a Transformer-based trajectory tracking model is developed to construct a behavioral digital replica comprising of multiple workers’ historical trajectories from the bird's-eye view perspective. Subsequently, a LSTM-based model, combined with the social pooling mechanism, is deployed to obtain spatiotemporal interactive features from the historical trajectories and predict workers’ future motions. Experiments are conducted on a dataset (WHUT-MF) collected from real-world constructions sites. Our framework achieves 0.528 m in ADE and 0.84 m in FDE on entire WHUT-MF, which demonstrate that the proposed digital twin-based motion forecasting model accurately predicts the future trajectories of workers in various scenarios with potential risks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cloud edge collaboration; Digital twin; Motion forecasting; Risk monitoring","Data privacy; Long short-term memory; Risk perception; Trajectories; Cloud edge collaboration; Computational burden; Construction engineering; Construction sites; Critical tasks; Industrial fields; Motion forecasting; Risk monitoring; Uncertainty; Workers'; Forecasting","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177239163"

In addition, a digital twin provides greater support for the application of probabilistic methods for prognostication and risk assessment following model updating and diagnostics provided by structural health monitoring. To date, digital twins have been predominantly applied in the advanced manufacturing space, although the increased use of modular and prefabricated construction has driven interest in the extension of digital twin technology to both civil and nuclear structures. This chapter details the implementation of a structural digital twin and investigates its influence on the performance of a Bayesian vibration-based structural health monitoring approach. In this chapter, a digital twin is developed throughout the construction of a model-scale steel-plate composite modular wall in a laboratory environment. Throughout the design, fabrication, and erection of the specimen, design calculations, numerical models, LiDAR point clouds, physical measurements of geometric features, and quality control inspection data are integrated into a digital twin framework to develop an as-built representation of the structural geometry, material properties, and condition throughout the stages of construction. The modular nature of the construction results in different effective section properties for wall modules as the early-age elastic properties of the structural concrete are developed. This time dependency of the section properties is leveraged to produce a series of datasets where structural parameters in the model evolve due to aging. Probabilistic model updating using modal parameters obtained from experimental modal analyses is used for structural identification of the as-built model. Static loading of the specimen with supplemental instrumentation is used to validate the parameter estimates. The performance of the vibration-based structural identification is evaluated both with and without the as-built information produced by the structural digital twin framework. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin; LiDAR structural scanning; Probabilistic model updating; Structural health monitoring; Vibration-based condition assessment","Inspection; Optical radar; Parameter estimation; Risk assessment; Structural health monitoring; Structural properties; Walls (structural partitions); Condition assessments; LiDAR structural scanning; Measurements of; Model updating; Modulars; Performance; Probabilistic model updating; Probabilistic models; Property; Vibration-based condition assessment; Modal analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175964040"

Research on the digital twin product model recommendation method is of great significance for the rapid construction and reuse of digital twins. The methods currently in use, however, principally concentrate on geometric reuse and pay little attention to functional or knowledge reuse. In this paper, a graph neural network (GNN)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for product model recommendation is presented. First, an MBD (model-based definition)-based semantic feature attribute adjacency graph (MSFAAG) is introduced to structured MBD model as the carrier of the digital twin product model. The MSFAAG is then embedded into continuous vector spaces using a GNN to obtain the categorization of these MBD models. Finally, DRL is used to adaptively identify more important semantic features, including manufacturing semantics and functional semantics, to obtain more detailed model classification results. The experiment effectively improves the reuse efficiency of the non-geometric aspects of the digital twin product and MBD model. Compared with other traditional recommendation algorithms, the algorithm proposed in this paper has higher accuracy and can well meet the design requirements of users. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","deep reinforcement learning; graph neural networks; Model based definition; reuse, recommendation","Deep learning; Graph neural networks; Recommender systems; Semantics; Vector spaces; Deep reinforcement learning; Feature attributes; Model-based definitions; Network-based; Product models; Reinforcement learnings; Reuse; Reuse, recommendation; Semantic features; Reinforcement learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173517386"

However, fostering robust social relationships among objects within intelligent environments requires considering a multitude of parameters, from historical transactions data to peer opinions on interaction experiences. Our primary objective is to introduce the VISO concept, a finely tuned approach for community formation and facilitating autonomous interactions among Social IoT objects. Key contributions of VISO include: (i) a recommendation mechanism for cultivating friendships; (ii) the virtualization of devices, known as Virtual Objects, based on the Digital Twin concept; (iii) object ranking, determined by peer evaluations at the edge; and (iv) profiling the identity of each object within the environment. The VISO approach is rooted in the link analysis model, which seeks to uncover connections between individuals and qualify interactions. Additionally, the construction of social circles is guided by the Organizational Network Analysis model, a concept grounded in social networks designed to simplify the initiation of new friendships. The VISO approach stands out through its amalgamation of dynamic trust mechanisms, object virtualization, real-time interaction monitoring, and the highlighting of the most active objects. These characteristics collectively contribute to its effectiveness in managing relationships within the social IoT, while simultaneously addressing challenges posed by alternative models. Preliminary results in a testing environment substantiate the model's capability to categorize interactions and identify the most beneficial object roles for establishing new relationships. In particular, by selecting the most active objects 30%, they account for a staggering 90% of local actions. These validation outcomes lay the foundation for planned future work and enhancements to the VISO approach. Encouraged by the promising results, the inception of a significant project is on the horizon. The application of the VISO approach to relationship management within a smart campus for ubiquitous education underscores the remarkable versatility and potential of Social IoT. This application has the power to elevate various facets of campus life, ranging from education to resource management, creating a transformative impact within the educational landscape. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin; Interaction; Link analysis; Recommendation; Relationship; Social IoT","Automation; Digital devices; Intelligent buildings; Virtual reality; Virtualization; Active object; Home healthcare; Interaction; Link analysis; Recommendation; Relationship; Smart homes; Social IoT; Technological expansion; Virtualizations; Internet of things","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171598871"

The existing scheduling system cannot realize the information interaction and collaborative integration between the physical world and the virtual world, while the digital twin (DT) technology can effectively solve the problem of real-time information interaction and the reinforcement learning (RL) method can cope with dynamic scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposed a DT-driven RL method to solve the marine equipment vehicle scheduling problem. Given the dynamic nature of transportation tasks, the diversity of transported goods, and the optimization characteristics of transportation requirements, a framework for scheduling transportation vehicle operations based on DT is constructed, and a RL-based vehicle scheduling method in a dynamic task environment is proposed. A Markov decision process (MDP) model of the vehicle scheduling process is established to realize one-to-one mapping between information and physical elements. An improved RL method based on Q-learning is proposed to solve the MDP model, and the value function approximation and convergence enhancement methods are applied to optimize the solving process. Finally, a case study is used for example verification to prove the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method in this paper. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin; marine equipment; Q-learning; vehicle scheduling","Approximation algorithms; Dynamics; E-learning; Job shop scheduling; Markov processes; Materials handling; Reinforcement learning; Vehicles; Virtual reality; Dynamic scheduling; Job-Shop scheduling; Optimisations; Q-learning; Reinforcement learning method; Scheduling methods; Task analysis; Transportation vehicles; Vehicle scheduling; Vehicle's dynamics; Oceanographic equipment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164670427"

A new set of indexes are also introduced with the objective of facilitating the evaluation of the technological level of the shipyard, thereby allowing the understanding of the shipyard's interest in new developments. The analysis of the survey conducted shows that almost the 95% of shipyards either currently use or plan to use composite materials, being the composites made of fibreglass and polyester resin the most used. These composites are mainly manufactured by manual lamination and vacuum infusion techniques. The survey has also shown that there is a high interest in the shipyard digitisation and the use of new technologies in the shipbuilding industry, especially for new construction shipyards. The study shows that despite shipyards want to adopt digitisation in engineering and design processes, implementation of new technologies and concepts is being held back by financial cost and uncertainty regarding outcomes such as improved operational efficiency of vessels. The shipyards that do not use composites are less technologically advanced than those that use them, according to the analysis of the technological indexes.

This however faces a fundamental difficulty due to the inadequate data sharing among social entities, which has become one of the key barriers to the in-depth development of smart city, making wasted information resources and application silos ubiquitous. As an emerging communication paradigm, the digital twin network (DTN) has potential to eliminate the data sharing barrier in smart city. By mapping the social physical entities (PEs) in smart city to digital virtual agents, namely data twins (DTs), valuable data can be directly shared among the DTs over DTN without physical constraints, and form decisions that feed back and guide the operation of PEs. In this article, we explore the role of DTN in supporting the smart city and promoting data sharing construction. We first introduce the basic concepts related to DTN and propose the architecture of DTN-enabled smart city. The key features of DTN-enabled smart city are then discussed with an emphasis on the security and privacy issues with fundamental solutions around data sharing in DTN-enabled smart city.

Prefabricated construction, noted for its efficiency, environmental friendliness, and reduced labor requirements, has attracted significant attention. While research on intelligent construction in the prefabricated industry is expanding, comprehensive literature reviews analyzing and synthesizing these findings remain limited. To this end, this article undertakes a systematic literature review, analyzing 114 papers closely related to intelligent methodologies in prefabricated construction. It encompasses the prefabricated construction lifecycle: design, manufacturing, construction, and operations and maintenance. Statistical analysis reveals that building information modeling (BIM), the genetic algorithm, and laser scanning have emerged as the three most prevalent intelligent methodologies in this field. Furthermore, we conducted an in-depth literature analysis and identified the current research gaps. Future directions are suggested, including generative artificial intelligence design, dynamic production scheduling optimization methods, fully automated process quality inspection methods, long-range transportation methods for electric vehicles, low-cost digital twin monitoring techniques, and multidimensional, comprehensive lifecycle management systems.

Masonry buildings are particularly relevant in this context and the proper definition of mechanical parameters can be a crucial issue since they can vary in a wide range significantly affecting the outcomes of the assessment and the intervention strategies. A robust treatment of material uncertainties would require a substantial number of material tests, which can be both costly and time-consuming, as well as not aligned with the requirements of preservation. For this reason, it is extremely useful to rely on Bayesian inverse methods for the calibration of structural models based on limited measurements of the structural response. In the paper, the main steps towards the definition of digital twin for structural purposed of a heritage building are presented with reference to a significant case study, the Palazzo Poniatowski-Guadagni in Florence, a 18th century masonry building serving today as the headquarter of the local police. First, the development of Building Information Model (BIM) based on laser scanner survey data and the subsequent derivation of Finite Element (FE) model is shown. Then, a generalized Polynomial Chaos expansion (gPCE) surrogate model is introduced to reproduce the natural frequencies of the building. The surrogate model significantly decreases the computational time of the physics-based FE model, allowing the propagation of uncertainties in material properties, such as the elastic and Poisson’s ratio of masonry, relevant for the building’s dynamic response. Global sensitivity analyses are carried out using Sobol’ indices to assess the impact of input variability on the eigenfrequencies, evaluating the need for experimental campaigns and the set-up of a structural health monitoring (SHM) system. Replacing the deterministic FE solver with a gPCE surrogate model will facilitate quasi-real-time SHM. Therefore, the outcome will be a digital twin that serves as a tool for early warning and damage detection, relying on the Bayesian inference approach. The developed digital twin will be part of the BUILDCHAIN system, including Digital Building Logbook (DBL) and BIM, contributing to demonstrate the benefits of implementing innovative DBLs for management and preservation of cultural heritage. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cultural Heritage; FE models; Masonry Structures; Structural Health Monitoring; Surrogate models; Uncertainty Quantification","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012427354"

In an offline preparation phase, the geometry of a built environment is discretized with a finite element (FEM) mesh and a reduced-order model (ROM) of the steady-state incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is constructed for various wind conditions. Subsequently, the ROM provides a fast wind field estimate based on the current wind speed during the online phase. To support crisis management, several methodological building blocks are combined. Automatic FEM meshing of built environments and numerical flow solver capabilities enable fast forward-simulations of contaminant dispersion using the advection-diffusion equation as transport model. Further methods are integrated in the framework to address inverse problems such as contaminant source localization based on sparse concentration measurements. Additionally, the contaminant dispersion model is coupled with a continuum-based pedestrian crowd model to derive fast and safe evacuation routes for people seeking protection during contaminant dispersion emergencies. The interplay of these methods is demonstrated in two critical infrastructure protection (CIP) test cases. Based on simulated real world interaction (measurements, communication), this article demonstrates a full Measurement-Inversion-Prediction-Steering (MIPS) cycle including a Bayesian formulation of the inverse problem. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Fluid Dynamics; Digital Twin; Emergency Evacuation; Inverse Problems; Source Detection; Stabilized Finite Element Method","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012425815"

One of their main applications in the field of bridge engineering is the possibility of real-time damage detection. To achieve this, advanced anomaly detection algorithms need to be validated to alert bridge operators on the risks related to the detected anomalies. A synthetic data generation framework has been proposed to generate benchmark databases for testing and validation as a cheaper and faster alternative to the collection of real monitoring data. In this paper we present the S101 Bridge, which has been selected as first case study for the generation of the proposed synthetic database. A finite element model of the bridge was developed and calibrated based on the reported natural frequencies and mode shapes of the actual structure available in the literature. The calibration process is described in detail along with the sensitivity analysis of the considered parameters. The results indicate a strong agreement between the first four natural frequencies and mode shapes of the experimental and numerical bridge model. It is concluded that the calibrated model is suitable for the generation of bride digital twins what-if scenarios, which will be of great significance for both practitioners and the research community. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Calibration; Digital twins; FAIR data; Finite element method; Pre-stressed concrete bridge","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012423633"

The main reason for all these challenges is the lack of efficiently utilizing training documentations. To address this and reduce costs while mitigating the negative implications of machine breakdowns, we propose a two-phase framework consisting of knowledge graph construction and diagnosis.

The DT concept, which originated in the 2000s, has gained momentum across various industries. Yet, integrating DT into the construction industry, particularly in water systems, is at an early stage. A comprehensive literature review is conducted to explore the potential benefits of DT in water management, aligning with the principles of LC. The exploration reveals the integration of DT into diverse water systems, encompassing distribution networks, sewage systems, river and lake management, dam systems, and wastewater treatment plants. The identified benefits extend beyond operational efficiency to water sustainability, addressing climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction, and resource optimization. The study also explores the tools and technologies employed in DT applications, emphasizing their alignment with LC principles of reducing waste and fostering collaboration. Nevertheless, limitations exist in the identified tools and technologies, such as data interoperability, computational complexities, and data reliability, underscoring areas for future research to enhance DT application effectiveness. Despite these limitations, the synthesis of DT, LC, and water sustainability holds promise for transforming water resource management. This study offers guidance on achieving efficient, sustainable, and collaborative water management across various contexts. It provides essential insights for scholars, practitioners, and policymakers, emphasizing the importance of policy support and technological innovation to overcome current challenges.

The integration of DT and high-fidelity modelling enables real-time monitoring, fault diagnosis, performance evaluation and optimization of physical entities.

However, DTs often face challenges related to data scarcity, especially in AECO, where tests are costly and difficult to scale. Historical data in this domain are often limited, unstructured and lack interoperability standards. Data scarcity directly affects the accuracy and reliability of the DT models and their decision-making capabilities. To address these challenges, classical methods are used to produce synthetic data based on predefined statistical distributions, which are barely scalable to unpredictable scenarios and prone to overfitting. Alternately, this work presents a novel comprehensive approach that covers every aspect from synthetic data generation to training and testing of these data on the system’s models. This strategy not only delivers high-quality data that meets the model’s requirements in terms of diversity, complexity and class balance, but also provides the diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of the DT of the system through its trained models. State-of-the-art techniques including generative adversarial networks (GANs), specifically Wasserstein generative adversarial networks with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are employed in this novel pervasive approach, participating in the same architecture for generative, diagnostic and prognostic purposes. GANs enable data augmentation and reconstruction, while CNNs excel in spatial pattern recognition tasks. The proposed framework is demonstrated through an experimental case study on damage diagnostics and prognostics of a laboratory-scale metallic tower, where synthetic datasets are generated to supplement limited health monitoring data.

Cracks are always observed on a smart concrete girder bridge. In particular, some of the cracks are induced by overloaded vehicles, which is dangerous to its safe operation. However, due to the crack opening and closing effect, it exhibits nonlinear responses, posing challenges for accurately assessing its health condition. Influence lines (ILs) are a promising indicator for bridge damage. However, there is limited research on the effect of cracks on the ILs of a smart concrete girder bridge. A digital twin is commonly used to accompany the smart sensing system to accurately evaluate the health condition, where the finite element (FE) model is of great importance. Therefore, this study proposes an element size–independent FE model construction method based on the concrete damage plasticity (CDP) model to investigate the changes of displacement and strain ILs of different types of smart concrete girder bridges with bending cracks, which is helpful to guide how to use the ILs to identify the cracks and evaluate the health condition. Initially, a concrete constitutive model based on crushing/fracture energy is proposed, and the evolution law of tensile damage based on fracture energy is derived to construct the element size–independent FE model. Subsequently, experiments on a reinforced concrete (RC) simply supported beam and a prestressed concrete (PC) simply supported bridge subjected to bending failure are used to verify the FE models constructed by the proposed method. Finally, the FE models of a smart RC T-beam bridge and a smart three-span PC continuous bridge are established to study the changes in ILs caused by bending cracks. The change of displacement IL at the midspan due to cracks for the smart RC bridge exceeds 10% when the reinforcements yield, while it is less than 10% for the smart PC bridge even if the bridge is in the failure state. The change of both displacement and strain ILs becomes greater when the measurement point approaches the cracks, and the change of strain IL is only detectable when the measurement is close to the cracks. Due to the crack opening and closing effect, the displacement and strain ILs of a smart concrete girder bridge with bending cracks are inconsistent when different loads are applied. The findings can also be used as a pre-IL-based crack detection using the passing inspection vehicle-induced dynamic response on a selection of type of ILs, determination of layout of sensors, and mass of inspection vehicle. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","concrete damage plasticity model; crack opening and closing effect; FE model; influence line; smart concrete girder bridge","Aluminum beams and girders; Bond strength (materials); Bridge approaches; Bridge decks; Concrete beams and girders; Concrete bridges; Crack closure; Heat affected zone; Particle tracking; Prestressed beams and girders; Prestressed concrete; Steel bridges; Tensile strength; Toll bridges; Concrete damage plasticity models; Crack closing; Crack opening; Crack opening and closing effect; Finite element modelling (FEM); Girder bridges; Health condition; Influence lines; Smart concrete; Smart concrete girder bridge; Fracture energy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002219593"

Yet, the proposed dynamic multi-layered map needs to be validated in real-world scenarios, which are not evident for such off-road domains.

Firstly, a refined digital model of the main transformer was established and the multi-physical field real-time simulation analysis was carried out to obtain the electromagnetic field and loss distribution cloud maps of its key components. Then, in order to solve the problems that the simulation of the flow field and temperature field of the main transformer took a long time and the real-time monitoring of operating states could not be realized, a fast calculation method of coupling field was proposed. Finally, the digital twin of the main transformer was constructed by combining the proposed method with the operating state data collected by various sensors, achieving multi-dimensional, full process and panoramic state monitoring and display for the physical main transformer. The results show that the construction of digital twins can realize the real-time monitoring and predictive evaluation of the operating state of main transformers under different working conditions, which provides convenience for the operation and maintenance inspection of the main transformer and contributes to the safe and reliable operation of nuclear power plants. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","coupling field; digital model; digital twin; fast calculation; main transformer; nuclear power plant; 主变压器; 快速计算; 数字孪生; 数字模型; 核电厂; 耦合场","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000356762"

Besides, digital twin (DT) is considered as an effective solution for PdM deployment because it significantly enhances data-driven insights and enables proactive interventions. However, most existing studies on indoor climate focus on condition monitoring or anomaly detection rather than failure prediction, which has higher requirements for data and algorithms. In this study, the remaining useful life (RUL) and time shift (TS) methods are employed to split the prediction problem into the combination of a supervised and an unsupervised subtask, followed by the development of a parallel prediction model integrating the long short-term memory network (LSTM) and autoencoder (AE) methods. Besides, a DT-enabled PdM framework has been proposed for indoor climates, validated through the establishment of an online platform designed to reconstruct the 3D building model and demonstrate real-time monitoring and alert information of indoor climates. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed model under different warning times and fault severity through a comparison study with other 4 benchmark models based on a practical dataset collected from different buildings in Singapore, while the practical online platform serves as an illustrative case for future DT-enhanced PdM solutions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin; Ensemble model; Failure prediction; Indoor climate; Neural network; Predictive maintenance","Air quality; Anomaly detection; Climate models; Condition monitoring; Construction industry; Forecasting; Learning systems; Maintenance; Perovskite; Three dimensional computer graphics; Auto encoders; Building industry; Ensemble models; Failures prediction; Indoor climate; Memory network; Neural-networks; Online platforms; Predictive maintenance; Work efficiency; Long short-term memory","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176504671"

Consequently, urban planners have a strong interest in digital twin technology, since it provides them with a laboratory for experimenting with data before making far-reaching decisions. Realizing these decisions involves the work of professionals in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) domain who nowadays collaborate via the methodology of building information modeling (BIM). At the same time, the citizen plays an integral role both in the data acquisition phase, while also being a beneficiary of the improved resource management strategies. In this paper, we present a prototype for a ""digital energy twin""platform we designed in cooperation with the city of Regensburg. We show how our extensible platform design can satisfy the various requirements of multiple user groups through a series of data processing solutions and visualizations, indicating valuable design and implementation guidelines for future projects. In particular, we focus on two example use cases concerning building electricity monitoring and BIM.

The state of the art results on controlling DSTAs are however not ideal: in the case of infinite horizon, optimal controllers do not exist, while for timed bounded behaviors, we do not know how to build such controllers, even ?-optimal ones. In this paper, we develop a theory of Reinforcement Planning in the setting of DSTAs, for discounted infinite horizon objectives. We show that optimal controllers do exist in general. Further, for DSTAs with 1 clock (which already generalize Continuous Time MDPs with e.g. timeouts), we provide an effective procedure to compute ?-optimal controllers. It is worth noting that we do not rely on the discretization of the time space, but consider symbolic representations instead. Evaluation on a DSTA shows that this method can be more efficient. Last, we show on a counterexample that this is the furthest this construction can go, as it cannot be extended to 2 or more clocks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","planning; reinforcement planning; timed automata","Automata theory; Clocks; Continuous time systems; Controllers; Embedded systems; Reinforcement; Stochastic models; Technology transfer; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Dense-time; Infinite horizons; Optimal controller; Optimal policies; Reinforcement planning; State of the art; Stochastics; Timed Automata; Stochastic systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180790960"

However, for dynamic environments such as construction sites, the constantly changing conditions hinder a manager from planning the UGV’s paths. For an autonomous monitoring mission, the path planning should be dealt with by having a map with the site’s most recent scene. In this study, we develop a mobile app capable of local map updates by overlaying an image on a mapping API (e.g., Google Maps) hence working as a digital twin capable of creating a dynamic representation of the updated terrain over the mapping API. UGV operators can draw a path on such an updated construction scene using a tablet PC or smartphone. Discrete GPS information (e.g., latitudinal, and longitudinal) is executed for the UGV’s controller. In the overlaying procedure, the homographic relation between the image and map is automatically computed and then projected. We successfully demonstrated the capabilities of the technique with two construction sites and a soccer field using images from the ground and satellite, respectively.

Terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) is one of those state-of-the-art technologies which has simplified the structural survey and assessment. TLS can rapidly acquire millions of 3D data points from an entire structural surface with high precision in a short period of time, encompassing the physical position and geometrical details of the subjected object in the form of a digital replica known as Digital Twin (DT). A Digital Twin is the set of all digitally represented data, which can greatly benefit engineers in terms of generating a realistic 3D model of the structure and identifying the structural deformities such as deformations, displacements, surface anomalies/irregularities, etc. Despite the significant benefit of this technology, there has been limited research studies on its application and evaluation in terms of accuracy in structural monitoring and assessment. Therefore, this research paper aims to provide an experimental program that not only measures and quantifies the performance of TLS, but also evaluates its accuracy in comparison to other conventional single-point measurement equipment. In this regard, a simply supported structural beam has been considered as a structural object and subjected to monotonic loading. Meanwhile, the deformation of the beam has been captured using a few methods including TLS. The finding of this research showed that the TLS performed remarkable well with errors less than 2% compared to other accurate approaches of measurements. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Twin; Numerical method; Reliability experimentation; Structural health monitoring; Structural measurement; Terrestrial laser scanner","3D modeling; Damage detection; Laser applications; Seebeck effect; Steel beams and girders; Structural health monitoring; Surveying instruments; Three dimensional computer graphics; Damage measurement; Health assessments; Measurements of; Monitoring and assessment; Reliability experimentation; Structural assessments; Structural elements; Structural measurements; Terrestrial laser scanners; Terrestrial laser scanning; Numerical methods","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177821395"

At present, in the whole life cycle of an object in the AEC industry, it is mostly applied in the operation and maintenance (O&M) stage. Although there is a lot of DT application research, these studies are scattered across different topics in different engineering objects of the AEC industry. The common application strategy for the applications of DT in the O&M stage of the AEC industry has not yet been fully understood. So many fresh researchers who want to apply DT to new problems in the field are not clear which technologies should be used and how to organise them together. In this regard, the optional enabling technologies are given based on a bibliometric search, and a complete common strategy for DT application in the O&M stage of the AEC industry is established, which supplements the theory of the AEC field. Meanwhile, the existing gaps and research opportunities at the technical level are secondly identified. To achieve this goal, there are 825 publications related to DT applications in the AEC industry O&M stage are analysed, published between 2016.1.1 and 2023.7.28. The digital twin enabling techniques are summarised from four aspects in the paper. Firstly, the common technologies used in different current research topics are concluded and analysed in the review. Then, the enabling technologies for digital twin are concluded systematically from the perspective of the digital twin five-dimensional model.

From IoT (Internet of things) to an all-element information network architecture combining IoB (Internet of behavior), IoR (Internet of rule), and IoT, the existing data collection and transmission cannot meet the requirements. In order to achieve high real-time data collection and transmission of all-element data in the digital twin, a digital twin connection module framework for the production shop is proposed. The proposed framework uses the virtual sensor technology to complete the information collection of IoT and establishes the information network system of IoB and IoR. On this basis, a digital twin information collection model is constructed to complete the data integration and finally complete the data transmission. Based on OPC UA, a prototype framework of an all-element digital twin model connection module is developed, through which the construction of the all-element information network of IoT, IoB, and IoR has been completed, and a complete information path can be built.

The existing intelligent manufacturing system cannot satisfy efficient human-robot collaborative work. However, unlike machines equipped with sensors, human characteristic information is difficult to be perceived and digitized instantly. In view of the high complexity and uncertainty of the human body, this paper proposes a framework for building a human digital twin (HDT) model based on multimodal data and expounds on the key technologies. Data acquisition system is built to dynamically acquire and update the body state data and physiological data of the human body and realize the digital expression of multi-source heterogeneous human body information. A bidirectional long short-term memory and convolutional neural network (BiLSTM-CNN) based network is devised to fuse multimodal human data and extract the spatiotemporal features, and the human locomotion mode identification is taken as an application case. A series of optimization experiments are carried out to improve the performance of the proposed BiLSTM-CNN-based network model. The proposed model is compared with traditional locomotion mode identification models.

For example, electronic design automation (EDA) has played an important role in both academia and industry. Design automation for intelligent robots refers to the construction of unified modular graph models for the morphologies (body), controllers (brain), and vision systems (eye) of intelligent robots under digital twin architectures, which effectively supports the automation of the morphology, controller, and vision system design processes of intelligent robots by taking advantage of the powerful capabilities of genetic programming, evolutionary computation, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and causal reasoning in model representation, optimization, perception, decision making, and reasoning. Compared with traditional design methods, MOdular DEsigN Automation (MODENA) methods can significantly improve the design efficiency and performance of robots, effectively avoiding the repetitive trial-and-error processes of traditional design methods, and promoting automatic discovery of innovative designs. Thus, it is of considerable research significance to study MODENA methods for intelligent robots. To this end, this paper provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of applying MODENA in intelligent robots, analyzes the current problems and challenges in the field, and provides an outlook for future research. First, the design automation for the robot morphologies and controllers is reviewed, individually, with automated design of control strategies for swarm robots also discussed, which has emerged as a prominent research focus recently. Next, the integrated design automation of both the morphologies and controllers for robotic systems is presented. Then, the design automation of the vision systems of intelligent robots is summarized when vision systems have become one of the most important modules for intelligent robotic systems. Then, the future research trends of integrated “Body-Brain-Eye” design automation for intelligent robots are discussed.

In order to enhance both human well-being and robotic flexibility within HRC, numerous research efforts have been dedicated to the exploration of human body perception, but many of these studies have focused only on specific facets of human recognition, lacking a holistic perspective of the human operator. A novel approach to addressing this challenge is the construction of a human digital twin (HDT), which serves as a centralized digital representation of various human data for seamless integration into the cyber-physical production system. By leveraging HDT, performance and efficiency optimization can be further achieved in an HRC system. However, the implementation of visual perception-based HDT remains underreported, particularly within the HRC realm. To this end, this study proposes an exemplary vision-based HDT model for highly dynamic HRC applications. The model mainly consists of a convolutional neural network that can simultaneously model the hierarchical human status including 3D human posture, action intention, and ergonomic risk. Then, on the basis of the constructed HDT, a robotic motion planning strategy is further introduced with the aim of adaptively optimizing the robotic motion trajectory. Further experiments and case studies are conducted in an HRC scenario to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","computer vision; deep learning; human digital twin; human-robot collaboration; smart manufacturing","E-learning; Flow control; Motion planning; Robot programming; Robot vision; Deep learning; Human bodies; Human digital twin; Human-centric; Human-robot collaboration; Modeling approach; Research efforts; Smart manufacturing; Vision based; Well being","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164885130"

In this paper, we address two key challenges that limit our ability to fully exploit the potential of images. The first is the “semantic gap” between low-level image features and high-level semantic descriptions. The second is the lack of principled integration between images and other digital systems used in construction, such as construction schedules and building information modeling (BIM). These challenges make it difficult to effectively incorporate images into digital twins of construction (DTC), a critical concept that addresses the construction industry’s need for more efficient project management and decision-making. To address these challenges, we first propose an ontology-based construction image interpretation (CII) framework to formalize the interpretation and integration workflow. Then, the DiCon-SII ontology is developed to provide a formalized vocabulary for visual construction contents and features. DiCon-SII also acts as a bridge between images and other digital systems to help construct an image-involved DTC. To evaluate the practical application of DiCon-SII and CII in supporting construction management tasks and as a precursor to DTC, we conducted a case study involving drywall installation. Via this case study, we demonstrate how the proposed methods can be used to infer the operational stage of a construction process, estimate labor productivity, and retrieve specific images based on user queries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","construction; digital twin construction (DTC); ontology; semantic image interpretation (SII)","Architectural design; Construction; Construction industry; Decision making; Image analysis; Project management; Quality control; Query processing; Semantics; Case-studies; Construction sectors; Digital system; Digital twin construction; Image interpretation; Image-based techniques; Ontology's; Ontology-based; Semantic image interpretation; Semantic images; Ontology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178384870"

Since the manufacturing of a semiconductor goes through very sophisticated and complex processes, efficient and accurate work and management are essential in the design, construction, and operation stages of the semiconductor fabrication (FAB) plant. Recently, the combined application of building information modeling (BIM) and augmented reality (AR) technology has gained increased attention in this semiconductor FAB industry as an advanced way to improve work efficiency and accuracy while eliminating other related problems, such as human errors. Despite the perceived benefits of combined use of BIM and AR, many technical problems still exist when integrating the target test model and the 3D virtual object model using BIM data and existing AR visualization technology, due to the unique characteristics of the FAB sites. To solve these problems, this study proposed an AR-based real-time BIM data compatibility verification method for future FAB digital twin implementation and demonstrated that it could be converted into a system and applied to actual FAB sites. As a result of the development and verification of this system, the proposed AR-based real-time BIM data compatibility verification system enables the accurate fitting of the AR model and actual object through AR tracking and anchoring technology considering the characteristics of FAB sites. After the fitting, the system was able to maintain compatibility, even when the camera moved and the marker moved away from the screen. By expanding the effective distance of compatibility between the AR model and the actual object, it was possible to increase the AR application range between the 3D virtual object model and the test target model and to improve the compatibility. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","augmented reality (AR); building information modeling (BIM); digital twin; extended reality (XR); fabrication facility (FAB)","Architectural design; Augmented reality; Fabrication; Information theory; Semiconductor device manufacture; Structural design; Three dimensional computer graphics; Building information modeling; Building Information Modelling; Compatibility verifications; Data compatibility; Extended reality (XR); Fabrication facility; Modeling data; Verification method; Virtual objects; Data visualization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178354879"

This provides an unprecedented opportunity to feed large amounts of sensing data collected from the physical factory into the construction of digital twin (DT) in cyberspace. However, little has been done to fully utilize the DT technology to improve the smartness and autonomous levels of small and medium-sized manufacturing factories. Indeed, only a small fraction of small and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs) has considered implementing DT technology. There is an urgent need to exploit the full potential of data analytics and simulation-enabled DTs for advanced manufacturing. Hence, this paper presents the design and development of DT models for simulation optimization of manufacturing process flows. First, we develop a multi-agent simulation model that describes nonlinear and stochastic dynamics among a network of interactive manufacturing things, including customers, machines, automated guided vehicles (AGVs), queues, and jobs. Second, we propose a statistical metamodeling approach to design sequential computer experiments to optimize the utilization of AGV under uncertainty. Third, we construct two new graph models - job flow graph and AGV traveling graph - to track and monitor the real-time performance of manufacturing jobshops. The proposed simulation-enabled DT approach is evaluated and validated with experimental studies for the representation of a real-world manufacturing factory. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology effectively transforms a manufacturing jobshop into a new generation of DT-enabled smart factories. The sequential design of experiments effectively reduces the computation overhead of expensive simulations while optimally scheduling the AGV to achieve production throughput cost-effectively.

Past DT research explored facility management and fault detection, highlighting a knowledge gap on the use of DT for smart construction and emissions monitoring in prefabrication supply chain (PSC). Therefore, the aim of this study is to present a holistic view of DT applications in PSC by exploring real-time smart construction and carbon emissions monitoring. A mixed-method review was adopted in two-steps involving scientometric and qualitative analysis in this study. Findings from the scientometric analysis revealed high interest in research themes such as emissions and energy control, artificial intelligence-based decision-making and blockchain integration in DT for prefabrication. Furthermore, the findings from the qualitative analysis demonstrated how smart technologies such as radio frequency identification (RFID), global positioning systems (GPS), laser scanners and sensors have been employed at the production, transportation, and on-site assembly stages of PSC for buildings. For real-time carbon emissions monitoring in DT, this study revealed various smart technologies and their corresponding information requirements for materials/components, machinery, and processes at each stage of the PSC.

They impact more and more every day life. Ensuring their correct construction, their well functioning and their reliability is an important issue for some of these systems which can be critical in case of dysfunction. The main requirements on physical architectures and control software are common to most of IoT-based systems. We propose, on the basis of the common architectural properties and the behaviour of IoT-based systems, the rigorous analysis of their intrinsic consistency properties; specific properties may also be considered and analysed. We propose a model-based approach to help in systematically modelling and analysing these systems. Our approach focuses both on the formalisation of the model of the targeted systems for their rigorous analysis purpose, and on the design of a modelling language as a domain specific language dedicated to describe IoT-based systems. We build a generic formal model which captures the common features and the properties required for any IoT-based system. This formal model is then a parametrised model where the parameters are the specific data and properties of a given system. The proposed DSL, named τila, is used to describe an IoT system which will be submitted to formal analysis of correctness. τila is a tiny declarative language, extensible, based on a library of building component blocks available as types. In fact, a description in τila helps to model a system, by collecting the parameters necessary to instantiate the generic formal model. Therefore the analysis requirements are based on the generic model. We experimented our approach using the proposed τila DSL for modelling and the Event-B framework for the formal analysis. The overall proposed approach is accompanied by a model editor generated to assist users in modelling an application and a prototype tool we have developed to assist the users in analysing their systems. Examples are provided. The generic formal model is extensible; it may be profitably adapted to more general hybrid or cyber–physical systems. Moreover, our generic model is independent of the target formal modelling tools; it may be implemented in various other formal analysis environments. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","DSL; Event-B; Generic model; Invariant properties; IoT applications","Digital subscriber lines; Internet of things; Problem oriented languages; Event-B; Formal analysis; Formal modeling; Generic modeling; Industrial area; Invariant properties; IoT application; Property; Rigorous analysis; Smart manufacturing; Modeling languages","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171830227"

Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors are effective in recognizing building facade components from (three-dimensional) 3D point clouds by registering 3D spatial coordinates and radiometric information, which reveal the spectral property of a scanned surface. Although the radiometric information (i.e., intensity feature) can be used for segmentation, its accuracy may be reduced by factors such as scanning geometry and external factors that affect the object's radiometric information. To address this issue, this study proposes a robust and automated method for segmenting building facade components using LiDAR point cloud data and an empirical-based intensity correction model to ensure proper segmentation. The proposed method employs RandLA-Net, a deep learning model capable of effectively processing large-scale point cloud data, to classify building facade components based on their spatial features combined with corrected intensity features. By incorporating the proposed method into a digital twin, it is possible to perform accurate building facade segmentation and generate valuable insights into the building's physical condition, energy efficiency, and aesthetic value in real-time. The effectiveness of the proposed method was experimentally validated using a school building facade, which demonstrated significant improvements in the recognition of facade components and highlighted the potential of digital twin-enabled building facade segmentation for the AEC industry. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Building facade; Digital twin; Intensity; Lidar; RandLA-Net","Classification (of information); Deep learning; Energy efficiency; Facades; Radiometry; Architectural construction; Architectural engineering; Building facades; Correction models; Facades segmentations; Intensity; Intensity features; Light detection and ranging; Radiometrics; Randla-net; Optical radar","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170087930"

Machine learning (ML) models trained in DT for MN (DTMN) virtual environments can be more robustly implemented in MN. This can avoid the training difficulties and runtime errors caused by MN instability and multiple failures. However, when using data from various devices in the MN system, DTs must prioritize data privacy. Federated learning (FL) enables the construction of models without data leaving devices to protect DTMN data privacy. Nevertheless, FL's privacy protection needs further improvement for it only guarantees device-level data ownership but ignores that models may retain private information from data. Therefore, this paper focuses on data forgetting in privacy protection, and proposes a novel FL-based unlearning framework (FedME2), which contains MEval and MErase modules. Guided by memory evaluation information from MEval and employing MErase's multi-loss training approach, FedME2 gets accurate data forgetting in DTMN. In four DTMN virtual environments, FedME2 achieves an average data forgetting rate of approximately 75% for global models under FL and kept the influence on global models' accuracy below 4%. FedME2 has better data forgetting and improves DTMN data privacy protection while guaranteeing model accuracy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twins; federated learning; machine unlearning","E-learning; Job analysis; Manganese; Virtual reality; Computational modelling; Digital replicas; Federated learning; Global models; Machine learning models; Machine unlearning; Network virtual environments; Privacy protection; Run-time errors; Task analysis; Data privacy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169675156"

Soil-foundation construction entails multiple uncertain underground safety risks, the elimination of which requires significant time and effort, thereby increasing the likelihood of schedule overruns. Automation and augmentation of progress monitoring are necessary for soil-foundation construction. There are two primary research challenges in the context of soil-foundation construction: the precise differentiation of objects with similar apparent characteristics, and the accurate detection of partially obscured objects. The existing approaches primarily address such issues by image post-processing rather than augmenting image feature inference. To enhance the efficiency of progress monitoring and facilitate unmanned inspection, an integrated computer vision-based framework for the tracking of soil-foundation construction progress was proposed. An improved SOLOv2 was utilized to qualitatively and quantitatively recognize the construction progress. Subsequently, the actual and differential progress could be integrated into streamlined BIM based on a self-adaptive grid-based mapping method. The approach was applied to a campus building project in China, resulting in a high segmentation accuracy (mAP = 90.9%). The improved SOLOv2 was found to surpass other state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms. Further, the impact of grid size on the mapping accuracy of construction progress was explored.

In response to this change, state DOTs began adopting a “transportation asset management” approach, an intensive data-driven decision-making process to maintain and extend the serviceability of transportation assets throughout their lifecycle. However, state DOTs continue to face challenges in conducting cross-asset system analysis and integrating data across systems throughout the asset lifecycle. Conversely, emerging technologies, namely Digital Twins, have the potential to leverage the value of asset data and transform data into valuable insights to inform decision-making. The definition of Digital Twins in the infrastructure industry is inconsistent, and the transition toward a digitized built environment—a preliminary step required for a successful implementation of Digital Twins—has not been investigated. Thus, this paper presents the burning platform for the need for Digital Twins and defines the concept. Additionally, this study investigates the current practices of state DOTs toward the digital transition of their transportation asset data and contextualizes the DOTs’ maturity in the advancement of digital processes. This paper focuses on ancillary asset systems, particularly Roadside, Electronic, and Drainage Asset systems. A web-based survey was developed and distributed to state DOTs for data collection.

At present, majority of Metaverse applications necessitate the manual construction of 3D models which is both time-consuming and costly. Additionally, it is challenging to design environments that can promptly react to users' actions. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach to generate virtual worlds using digital twin (DT) technology and AI through a Text-to-Metaverse pipeline. This pipeline converts natural language input into a scene JSON, which is used to generate a 3D virtual world using two engines: Generative Script Engine (GSE) and Generative Metaverse Engine (GME). GME generates a design script from the JSON file, and then uses it to generate 3D objects in an environment.

In this light, digital cameras, drones, and 3D laser scanners were utilized for 3D geometric documentation of the bridge. 3D finite element (FE) models were constructed and calibrated based on the operational modal analysis results derived from the accelerometer sensors. The fragility curves for different limit states were derived by performing a multi-stripe analysis (MSA). The effect of soil-structure interaction (SSI) on the calibration results and seismic response of the bridge was evaluated. The results of the visual inspection, model calibration, and seismic analysis revealed that the central pier and the arches are the most susceptible parts of the bridge. Therefore, three strengthening techniques were proposed, and corresponding numerical models were developed. The first model was developed by enhancing the mechanical properties of the vulnerable parts of the bridge, and the two other models were built by covering the central pier's outer surface with polyparaphenylene benzobisoxazole (PBO) and carbon fiber-reinforced concrete mortar (FRCM) layers. Results revealed that the strengthening techniques improved the seismic response of the bridge when subjected to transverse seismic excitations.

A digital and quantitative model representing the practical risk situation of the deep excavation is urgently required for realizing the prediction, optimization, and control of the actual construction state. Thus, this research aims to propose a real-world-oriented model integrating Bayesian network (BN) and design structure matrix (DSM) for decision-making in safety risk management. First, risk factors were identified, and the BN model was established to evaluate the anti-risk ability of the construction site. Then, a multi-objective safety measure optimization model under specific constraints was established. Particularly, the DSM was adopted to express the control relationship between risk factors and safety measures. Moreover, with genetic algorithms applied, the optimal safety measure set for on-site safety risk management can be obtained. For model validation, a deep excavation project of metro construction in Wuhan, China, was selected as a case study. The hybrid optimization model showed the characters of initiative and timeliness in construction risk management.

However, due to the vulnerability to measurement errors in weak-textured regions, 3D point clouds generated by conventional photometric consistency or deep learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) algorithms are often incomplete or inaccurate. Therefore, this paper integrates the consistency constraint across multiple views and the inferential capacity of deep learning to propose a novel approach for refining the missing regions of the depth maps generated by photo-consistency based MVS algorithms. The proposed solution involves a cost volume pyramid-based depth completion (CVP-DC) network with three multi-level pyramid structures, which sequentially estimates and completes depth maps in a coarse-to-fine manner. A dataset that consists of input images and the corresponding depth maps generated by photo-consistency based MVS algorithms, along with output ground truth depth maps, is developed using an open DTU MVS dataset. CVP-DC demonstrates competitive performance when tested on the public DTU MVS dataset, outperforming existing MVS algorithms in terms of both completeness and accuracy. Additionally, experimental studies are conducted utilizing UAV-collected RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) images of an outdoor bridge pier to reconstruct point clouds with absolute scales. Experimental validations demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach in filling uneven and incomplete depth maps, thereby enhancing the completeness of the generated point clouds.

Nonetheless, these studies have inadequately examined the reasons behind workers' engagement in unsafe behavior from a behavioral psychology perspective, specifically the collision reaction between impulsivity and self-control in the decision-making process, as well as the lack of exploration of psychological processes and behavioral response mechanisms of workers under different management strategies on construction sites. This paper describes an explanatory closed-loop structured model to simulate the safety performance of workers' behavior under different intervention strategies, considering the behavioral decision process and interactions between workers and managerial environment. The hybrid simulation model for worker's unsafe behavior consists of three parts: the control panel, the proactive management panel, and the reactive panel. The model provides valuable information for explaining the causation of workers’ unsafe behaviors and finding efficient management strategies. Through simulation experiments, results show that proactive management has more advantages in maintaining workers' behavioral safety levels over a long period of time than reactive management.

However, the significantly increased complexity of matching the irregularly distributed users and base stations as well as highly dynamic network traffic often cause unbalanced spatial-Temporal loads for multi-Tier base stations during user association. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new virtual network topology-based digital twin to reduce the complexity of load-balanced user association in 6G HetNets. During the digital twin construction stage, instead of using highly dynamic low-level physical layer attributes (e.g., channel conditions and SINR), we intentionally consider more stable and relevant communication performance indicators and physical statistics to effectively reflect both real-Time link quality and overall network dynamics. To assist overall network operation, fast update of the digital twin for HetNets is achieved by adopting principal component analysis to discover specific network areas with changes. To improve the overall QoS provisioning and network performance, the proposed virtual topology-based digital twin is further utilized to predict the spatial-Temporal dynamics of HetNets for more balanced user association by bipartite graph matching. Simulation results show that the proposed method can construct effective digital twins and support load-balanced user association with maximized network-wide QoS satisfaction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","6G; digital twin; heterogeneous networks; network topology; spatial-Temporal analysis; user association","Base stations; Complex networks; Dynamics; Heterogeneous networks; Interactive computer systems; Network layers; Network performance; Pattern matching; Principal component analysis; Quality control; Topology; 6g; 6g mobile communication; Complexity theory; Dynamic scheduling; Mobile communications; Network topology; Optimisations; Quality-of-service; Real - Time system; Spatial temporal analysis; User associations; Real time systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169671465"

Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) is a proven methodology to assess the environmental, social and economic impacts of a product system over its lifecycle. Applying LCSA to the construction domain is not trivial, as it needs to gather and connect data across several fields. A clear research gap was identified in the lack of data integration and completeness to carry out LCSA. This paper addresses this gap and shows how the complementary use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Digital Twin (DT) sourced data can facilitate and improve the LCSA of buildings. It includes a review of the current state of the art; proposes a novel methodological framework based on existing standards, and emphasises the roles of BIM and DT for conducting LCSA in the building context; this is tested in a case study of a real office building. The outcomes of the study demonstrate that the inclusion of usually neglected social impacts can be considered under LCSA, and that BIM and DT data provides better impact estimates, which are necessary to evaluate the performance gap between design estimated impacts and measured ones.

Deep learning-based methods have shown great potential in this field compared to traditional methods that rely on hand-crafted features. However, deep learning-based methods for railway point clouds still face typical challenges that need to be addressed. In this regard, we propose a novel learning framework named SALAProNet, which consists of a set of effective and concise modular solutions. The first challenge addressed is the massive data scale of railway point clouds, which makes it difficult to directly process large-scale point clouds due to memory limitations. To solve this problem, we adapt efficient random sampling in the network and propose the Self-Attentive Aggregation (SAA) module based on an attention mechanism to greatly expand the receptive field, which covers the unsampled points and successfully retains information in a high-dimensional feature space. The second challenge is fine-grained segmentation, where we propose the Local Geometry Embedding (LGE) module to embed local geometry. With the help of context information provided by SAA, the network can perform fine-grained segmentation for railway infrastructures. The third challenge is the insufficient generalization ability of the network, where we propose a Prototype Guided Regularization (PGR) method to guide the network to segment the point cloud among railways with different construction standards. This method enhances the network's interpretability and improves its generalization ability. We have validated our proposed framework through experiments on different datasets, and it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attention mechanism; digital twin; high-speed railway; infrastructure; point cloud semantic segmentation; prototype guided regularization","Deep learning; Geometry; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Rails; Semantic Segmentation; Three dimensional displays; Attention mechanisms; High-speed railways; Infrastructure; Point cloud compression; Point cloud semantic segmentation; Point-clouds; Prototype guided regularization; Rail transportation; Regularisation; Semantic segmentation; Three-dimensional display; Semantics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161473348"

The status of each building function is isolated in silos that are controlled by these third-party companies. Companies provide access to aggregated information in the form of reports through web portals, emails or bureaucratic processes. Digital twins represent an emerging approach to returning awareness and control to facility managers by automating all levels of information access (from granular data to defined key performance indicators and reports) and actuation. This paper proposes a low-latency data integration method that supports actuation and decision making in facility management, including construction, operation and maintenance data, and Internet of things. The method uses federated data models and semantic web ontologies, and it is implemented within a data lake architecture with connections to siloed data to keep the delegation of responsibilities of data owners.

Moreover, the software in CPS is often complex and low-level, making it hard to assure that a formal model of the system used for verification is a faithful representation of the actual implementation, which can undermine the value of a verification result. To address this problem, we propose a methodology for building verifiable CPS based on the principle that a formal model of the software can be derived automatically from its implementation. Our approach requires that the system implementation is specified in Lingua Franca (LF), a polyglot coordination language tailored for real-time, concurrent CPS, which we made amenable to the specification of safety properties via annotations in the code. The program structure and the deterministic semantics of LF enable automatic construction of formal axiomatic models directly from LF programs. The generated models are automatically checked using Bounded Model Checking (BMC) by the verification engine Uclid5 using the Z3 SMT solver. The proposed technique enables checking a well-defined fragment of Safety Metric Temporal Logic (Safety MTL) formulas. To ensure the completeness of BMC, we present a method to derive an upper bound on the completeness threshold of an axiomatic model based on the semantics of LF. We implement our approach in the LF Verifier and evaluate it using a benchmark suite with 22 programs sampled from real-life applications and benchmarks for Erlang, Lustre, actor-oriented languages, and RTOSes. The LF Verifier correctly checks 21 out of 22 programs automatically. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","automated verification; axiomatic modeling; concurrency; Cyber-physical systems; model-based design; safety MTL","Application programs; Benchmarking; Embedded systems; Formal verification; Linearization; Model checking; Real time systems; Semantics; Automated verification; Axiomatic models; Bounded model checking; Concurrency; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Formal modeling; Model-based design; Real- time; Safety MTL; Cyber Physical System","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171787934"

Recent monitoring techniques have utilized emerging technologies in Industry 4.0, such as the Internet of Things, Big Data analytics, cloud computing, and cybersecurity, to automate SHM methodologies. However, they have found challenges in linking these technologies and developing an autonomous, well-established digital framework for applications of SHM. Visualizing processed SHM data in a real-time digital interface generates multiple obstacles, such as witnessing delays in data transfer and resorting to offline tools for manual data processing. This paper, therefore, explores the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and the Internet of Things (IoT) through an Arduino micro-processing unit for tracking and visualizing the data from the time and frequency domains. Strategies for enabling data monitoring and processing are developed while continuously acquiring structural responses. The query of data is established in a web-based database instead of storing the data in offline resources that await manual intervention. The proposed real-time SHM methodology is validated experimentally using two practical applications: a dynamically moving vehicle over a simply-supported bridge prototype and a randomly excited three-story model with real-time visualization of both time- and frequency-domain information under undamaged and damaged conditions.

However, in practical engineering problems, reliability analysis (RA) often involves nonlinear, implicit, and computationally expensive relationships between the performance and uncertain parameters, which makes it very challenging to conduct time-dependent reliability analysis (TRA) instantly and accurately for a DT. This article proposes a new surrogate-based time-dependent reliability analysis (STRA) method for a DT, specifically making the following three contributions: (i) the number of discrete time nodes used to convert the stochastic processes into a series of random variables in the expansion optimal linear estimation process is dynamically selected, leading to a good tradeoff between the accurate representation of stochastic processes and fast reliability evaluation; (ii) based on Voronoi partition sampling and a modified leave-one-out cross-validation procedure, multiple sensitive subdomains in each iteration are selected simultaneously to guide adaptive sampling at the insufficiently fitted vicinity of the limit state function, which helps accurately calculate the probability of failure and reduce the number of design-of-experiment (DoE) samples; and (iii) an improved weighted expected feasibility function is proposed considering the importance of each sample and the sensitivity of the subdomain to which it belongs, which further improves the sampling efficiency. The proposed STRA method is applied to the TRA of a numerical model, a corroded beam structure, and a cutterhead of a tunnel boring machine to demonstrate its effectiveness for realistic DT applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adaptive sampling strategy; digital twin; expansion optimal linear estimation; kriging; metamodeling; reliability in design; surrogate model; time-dependent reliability analysis","Boring machines (machine tools); Construction equipment; Design of experiments; Function evaluation; Importance sampling; Iterative methods; Numerical methods; Random processes; Reliability analysis; Stochastic systems; Time series analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Adaptive sampling strategies; Expansion optimal linear estimation; Kriging; Linear estimation; Metamodeling; Reliability analysis method; Reliability in design; Subdomain; Surrogate modeling; Time dependent reliability analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176318552"

BIM technology tailored for pipelines offers in-depth semantic information and spatial data, bolstering the utility and implementation of digital twin-associated technologies in both architecture and urban planning. This paper introduces a rendering optimization algorithm rooted in the BSP Tree (Binary Space Partitioning Tree). The algorithm is used to address the challenges of slow loading and poor rendering quality of pipeline BIM models when displayed on the web, which stem from large amounts of model data and complex geometric configurations. Initially, the algorithm delves into the geometric distribution traits of the pipeline BIM model from multiple perspectives, pinpointing the spatial division dimension. Subsequently, it employs an adaptive step size technique for spatial segmentation, harmonizing it with real-world application contexts. Concurrently, any superfluous data that emerge are refined to uphold the structural wholeness of the BIM model. This algorithm is adept at systematically arranging and overseeing the BIM model data. Trial outcomes reveal that the AKDT (Adaptive K-Dimensional Tree) algorithm significantly trims the browser’s initial rendering duration while maintaining the model’s accuracy and semantic uniformity.

However, their thin-walled nature makes them geometrically sensitive to compressive loading. The Digital Twin (DT)-based numerical simulation method is developed using the actual geometries of CFS shapes, which are acquired by a 3D laser scanner. The DT-based numerical simulation incorporates the reconstructed measurement point clouds into the finite element modeling, ensuring that actual geometric features are retained. A series of tests, including material and axial compression testing, are conducted to validate the modeling parameters, such as mesh sizes and boundary conditions. The advantages of the DT-based numerical simulation method are highlighted compared to the traditional CFS member numerical simulation, which incorporates only the first mode of geometric imperfection. Additionally, DT-based numerical simulations offer more accurate load capacities and deformation predictions. Moreover, the automated and validated DT-based numerical simulation demonstrates prevalence in modeling efficiency and computation effectiveness.

In this paper, a knowledge graph (KG)-based multi-domain model integration method for digital twin workshops is proposed. The multi-domain model integration architecture based on KG is consisted of model element, model ontology, model data, semantic integration, and network connection. Then, the KG of multi-domain model for design, manufacturing, and simulation is constructed through ontology modeling and knowledge extraction. On this basis, multi-domain model integration is realized through semantic inference and knowledge query. The model parameters are updated through file exchange during the dynamic simulation. Finally, multiple scenarios in the subassembly workshop for hull construction are used to verify the efficacy of the proposed method.

However, the everincreasing complexity of underground utilities (e.g., water mains, gas lines, and sewage pipes) in urban environments challenges the safety of urban excavation, posing tremendous risks of potential collision and damage accidents. By obtaining real-time excavation information and high-fidelity simulation to evaluate safety risks, digital twin (DT) has an unexplored potential to improve urban excavation safety (UES). This research aims to investigate how a DT for urban excavation can be developed and used to improve UES. First, a multisensory solution is proposed to equip the physical excavators with the capability to precisely estimate their three-dimensional (3D) poses based on the kinematic model and social spider algorithm (SSA). Second, a building information model (BIM) of buried utilities and a 3D model of the excavators are integrated to form a dynamic virtual model that mirrors the actual excavation process. Third, based on the physical-virtual coupling DT, a real-time safety control method is proposed to proactively monitor urban excavation, dynamically assess collision risk, and timely warn against unsafe behaviors. A system prototype was developed and applied in a case study in Shandong, China. Results show that the system can precisely twin the pose of the excavator, increasing the estimation accuracy of the translation by at least 4.0 cm. The system can display the dynamic spatial position of the excavator and the buried pipes in 3D and automatically guide the excavator to operate safely in real-time, thereby avoiding potential collision accidents. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Building information modeling (BIM); Buried pipes; Cyber-physical system; Digital twin (DT); Smart construction; Urban excavation safety (UES)","3D modeling; Accidents; Architectural design; Construction equipment; Construction industry; Dynamics; Embedded systems; Excavation; Health risks; Information theory; Kinematics; Risk assessment; Sewage; Three dimensional computer graphics; Building information modeling; Building Information Modelling; Buried pipes; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Digital twin; Multisensory; Real- time; Smart construction; Urban excavation safety; Cyber Physical System","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164138580"

The integration of Digital Twin (DT) with IIoT digitizes physical objects into virtual representations to improve data analytics performance. Nevertheless, DT empowered IIoT generates a massive amount of data that is mostly sent to the cloud or edge servers for real-time analysis. However, unreliable public communication channels and lack of trust among participating entities causes various types of threats and attacks on the ongoing communication. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, we present a blockchain and Deep Learning (DL) integrated framework for delivering decentralized data processing and learning in IIoT network. The framework first present a new DT model that facilitates construction of a virtual environment to simulate and replicate security-critical processes of IIoT. Second, we propose a blockchain-based data transmission scheme that uses smart contracts to ensure integrity and authenticity of data. Finally, the DL scheme is designed to apply the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) against valid data retrieved from blockchain. In DL scheme, a Long Short Term Memory-Sparse AutoEncoder (LSTMSAE) technique is proposed to learn the spatial-temporal representation. The extracted characteristics are further used by the proposed Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA)-based Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) algorithm to learn long-distance features and accurately detect attacks.

Considering that buildings are complex geometric structures that may change throughout their lifespan, it is essential to maintain up-to-date DT geometry. Despite its importance, the relationship between a building's physical geometry and its DT counterpart remains under-researched due to technical, financial, and practical challenges. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current research on updating the geometry of DT in construction, identifying gaps and challenges for future research, with a focus on the life-cycle stages where updating the DT geometry is most relevant. Additionally, this paper examines the most used equipment and data collection methods, as well as the data processing and integration techniques used in DT. This study comprehensively reviews and analyses the DT concept, which involves the creation of a virtual model that accurately reflects the geometry of a physical object, and examines the DT concept from this perspective. Through a systematic literature review (SLR) and bibliographic analysis, this research examines various methods for updating the geometry of a DT. The methodology involved analyzing a final sample of 56 articles that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. On the basis of the analysis, the study identifies six main directions that recent publications in this field have focused on. These directions highlight the main achievements and obstacles in the field and include the use of UAV/photogrammetry and laser scanning as data collection methods for building geometry, data visualization, updating the geometry of the virtual model in manufacturing, the application of DT in modular construction, and structural monitoring. Based on the SLR, this study has identified key areas that require further research and existing challenges in updating the geometry of the DT. Addressing these challenges will be critical to promoting the widespread adoption of DT in the construction industry. Therefore, the study highlights the importance of updating geometry data in the DT to improve the quality of the data and maximize the benefits of technology in the construction sector. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Construction industry; Digital twin; Geometry; Life cycle; Systematic literature review","Data acquisition; Data handling; Data visualization; Geometry; Life cycle; Modular construction; 'current; Complex geometric structure; Data collection method; Data processing techniques; Life cycle stages; Lifespans; Physical geometry; Systematic literature review; Used equipment; Virtual models; Construction industry","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158902938"

This semantics includes as particular cases the standard Boolean (qualitative) semantics and the widely used real-valued robustness (quantitative) semantics. Our semantics also extends to truth values that are partially ordered and allows the modeling of uncertainty in satisfaction. We propose a compositional approach for the construction of online monitors that transform exact representations of piecewise constant (dense-time and continuous-time) signals. These monitors are based on a class of infinite-state deterministic signal transducers that (1) are allowed to produce the output signal with some bounded delay relative to the input signal, and (2) do not introduce unbounded variability in the output signal. A key ingredient of our monitoring framework is an efficient algorithm for sliding-window aggregation over dense-time signals.

This paper describes repeatability and reproducibility analyses for a commercially-available structured light scanning system and measurement artifact. The repeatability study used five repeated scans at 15 measurement positions. Repeatability was assessed by randomly selecting one of the five scans at each of the 15 positions and creating a part mesh. This process was performed 50 times and the statistics for the dimension variations were calculated to isolate the scanning effects only. The same sequence was then performed for 10 of the 15 positions and five of the 15 positions to evaluate the repeatability sensitivity to the number of measurement positions. Reproducibility was assessed by selecting 15 positions to create a mesh and repeating the 15-position measurement sequence 10 times using different positions for each mesh construction. The statistics for the dimension variations were then calculated. This incorporated the effects of both scanning and the position and orientation of the part relative to the scanner. This sequence was repeated for 10-position and five-position scans to evaluate the corresponding sensitivity. Finally, the artifact dimensions from structured light scanning were compared to coordinate measuring machine measurements of the same features. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Metrology; Repeatability; Reproducibility; Structured light scanning; Uncertainty","Measurement artifacts; Measurement positions; Mesh construction; Performance study; Repeatability; Reproducibilities; Scanning measurement; Scanning systems; Structured light scanning; Uncertainty; Mesh generation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173260707"

However, safety and reliability issues persist. The lack of flexibility and adaptability in current preprogrammed systems hampers real-time human-robot collaboration. A key gap in this area lies in the ability of the robot to interpret and accurately execute operations based on the real-time visual instructions and restrictions provided by the human collaborator and the working environment. This paper focuses on an MR-based human-robot collaboration method through visual feedback from a vision-based collaborative industrial robot system for use in wood stereotomy which we are developing. This method is applied to an alternating workflow in which a skilled carpenter lays out the joinery on the workpiece, and the robot cuts it. Cutting operations are instructed to the robot only through lines and conventional “carpenter’s marks”, which are drawn on the timbers by the carpenter. The robot system’s accuracy in locating and interpreting marks as cutting operations is evaluated by automatically constructing a 3D model of the cut shape from the vision system data. A digital twin of the robot allows the carpenter to previsualize all motions that are required by the robot for task validation and to know when to enter the collaborative workspace. Our experimental results offer some insights into human-robot communication requirements for collaborative robot system applications in timber frame construction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital twin; digital wood stereotomy; human-robot collaboration; mixed reality; robotic manufacturing; timber frame construction","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169097792"

Industry 5.0 complements the existing Industry 4.0 paradigm for the not-too-distant future by highlighting research and innovation as drivers for a transition to a sustainable, human-centric, and resilient industry. The core values of Industry 5.0 including human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience have prompted formal discussions that manufacturing should be human-centric. Human-centric smart manufacturing (HSM) takes full advantage of human flexibility, machine precision, and new-generation information technologies to construct a super smart, sustainable, and resilient manufacturing system. Nowadays, extensive research on the concept, architecture, enabling technologies, and applications of smart manufacturing have been conducted. However, research on HSM is relatively lacking, yet starting to gain traction rapidly. Hence, this paper primarily carries out a systematic literature review on HSM to identify promising research topics with high potential for further investigations. Firstly, this paper reveals the concept and connotation of HSM, on which the state-of-the-art architecture of HSM is introduced. Then, several promising Industry 4.0 technologies are identified as the key enablers that can continue to support the construction and operation of HSM, where a comprehensive survey and discussion on these technologies are conducted. Thirdly, what's new in HSM applications and how HSM will reshape the entire lifecycle of industrial products are explored. Finally, this paper identifies limitations, barriers, and challenges that will be encountered during the developing, operating, and maintaining HSM, and provides valuable research directions to continuously improve HSM. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Blockchain; Digital twin; Human-centric smart manufacturing; Industry 5.0","Blockchain; Industrial research; Life cycle; Block-chain; Core values; Distant futures; Human-centric; Human-centric smart manufacturing; Industrial revolutions; Industry 5.0; Manufacturing IS; Smart manufacturing; Systematic Review; Industry 4.0","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167455548"

In this paper, the Semantic Petri Net (SPN) is proposed as a method to represent the temporal states and rules in RDF and SPARQL so that a runnable temporal model can be implemented on a common SPARQL engine, and the state change rules can be checked with access to the rich domain knowledge provided by the semantic web.

For a digital twin city, a virtual high-fidelity CIM model that corresponds closely to the real physical world is the premise and cornerstone of its construction. Therefore, the integration of BIM, GIS and IoT has become the preferred topic for researchers and has received much more attention from a wide academic circle. However, traditional integration mainly focuses on the conversion of both IFC and CityGML, and IoT data are also often used as visualizations. More importantly, the underlying data formats of GIS, BIM and IoT are still independent of each other without a unified data structure expression, so real data-driven analysis and decision-making cannot be implemented. This study aims to establish a general CIM ontology to integrate heterogeneous BIM, GIS and IoT data. First, the related work of BIM, GIS and IoT integration is studied and analyzed. A comparison of three mainstream approaches, data conversion, standard extension and data linking, is conducted, and it illustrates the advantages of ontology techniques in solving data interoperability problems. Second, a technical framework of BIM, GIS and IoT data integration based on ontology technology is proposed. The approach is mainly divided into five steps: geometry processing, data instantiation, ontology construction, ontology mapping and querying application. On the basis of the CIM ontology, an application ontology is built for a specific application domain to illustrate rule-based mapping, querying and inferring. Finally, the case study shows that the Ontology-based methodology in this paper has contributed to establish a general pattern for CIM data integration by mapping and linking concepts from the semantic level. It avoids changes in the original data sources and the missing data problem. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BIM-GIS-IoT integration; CIM; Linked data; Ontology; Semantic integration","Architectural design; Data integration; Decision making; Geographic information systems; Information theory; Internet of things; Linked data; Mapping; Semantics; Smart city; BIM-GIS-IoT integration; City construction; City information model; High-fidelity; Information Modeling; Linked datum; Ontology's; Ontology-based; Semantic integration; Spatial-temporal data; Ontology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165486119"

In addressing flood-induced challenges, data usage has become important. Despite existing vast flood-related research, no research has presented a comprehensive insight into global studies on data-driven built environment flood resilience. Hence, this study conducted a comprehensive review of data-driven approaches to flood resilience. Scientometric analysis revealed emerging countries, authorships, keywords, and research hotspots. The critical review revealed data-centric approaches such as Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Flood Simulations, Bayesian Modelling, Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). However, they were mainly deployed in hydraulic flood simulations for prediction, monitoring, risk, and damage assessments. Further, the potentials of computational methods in tackling built environment resilience challenges were identified. Deploying the approaches in the future requires a better understanding of the status quo. These methods include hybrid data-driven approaches, ontology-based knowledge representation, multiscale modelling, knowledge graphs, blockchain technology, convolutional neural networks, automated approaches integrated with social media data, data assimilation, BIM models linked with sensors and satellite imagery and ML and AI-based digital twin models. Nevertheless, reference to data-informed built-asset resilience decisions and clear-cut implications on built-asset resilience improvement remain indistinct in many studies. This suggests that more opportunities exist to contextualise data for built environment flood resilience.

However, conventional prefabricated construction projects often suffer from challenges of managing numerous paper-based documentation, non-standardized management and intricate stakeholders in construction site management (CSM). The current design approaches lack sufficient consideration of the activity-based user relationships. To facilitate the system framework design and implementation for CSM, this study proposes a generic Cyber-physical Centered (CCD) Design, illustrating an effective and systematic approach to identify user-activity relationships in a cross-collaborative context. The consideration of entity, value chain and user-activity relationships facilitate identity management and value chain management services. The proposed approach was then utilized to a pilot project to design and implement the Blockchain-enabled Cyber-physical Site Management System (BCSMS) integrated with Digital Work Supervision System (DWSS), incorporating considerations on multi-source information flow and user-centric applications design. The implemented BCSMS decentralized two types of fundamental documents in CSM - Request for Inspection and Survey Checking (RISC) form and site diary. It addresses information fragmentation and asymmetry in a cross-collaborative environment caused by manual-input and error-prone records. The proposed system was evaluated by two important system performance indicators in terms of average response time and transaction per second. The system performance test shows that the accountability of BCSMS is significant compared to DWSS, given the p-value 0.01. Blockchain effectively improves DWSS with enhanced data submission, identity management and data-driven site performance evaluation functions. This study also qualitatively analyzed the pros and cons of proposed blockchain-enabled cyber-physical system (CPS) from society-economy-technology aspects for technical practitioners, construction stakeholders and governments. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Construction site management; Cyber-physical design; Cyber-physical system; User-centric design","Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Information management; Project management; Block-chain; Construction site managements; Cybe-physical design; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber physicals; Cyber-physical systems; Management systems; Physical design; Site management; User-centric designs; Blockchain","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165224853"

The digital twin has emerged as a solution that can update a BIM model with real-time data to achieve cyber-physical integration, enabling real-time monitoring of assets and activities and improving decision-making. The application of digital twins in the construction industry is still in its nascent stages but has been steadily growing over the past few years. A wide variety of emerging technologies are being used in the development of digital twins in diverse applications in construction but it is not immediately clear from the literature which ones are key to the successful development of digital twins, necessitating a systematic literature review with a focus on technologies. This paper aims to identify the key technologies used in the development of digital twins in construction in the existing literature, the research gaps and the potential areas for future research. This is achieved by conducting a systematic review of studies with demonstrative case studies and experimental setups in construction. Based on the observed research gaps, prominent future research directions are suggested, focusing on technologies in data transmission, interoperability and data integration and data processing and visualisation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Building information modelling (BIM); Digital construction technologies; Digital twin; Internet of Things; System architecture; Systematic literature review","Architectural design; Construction industry; Data integration; Decision making; Building information modeling; Building Information Modelling; Construction technologies; Digital construction; Digital construction technology; Digital solutions; Real-time data; Research gaps; Systematic literature review; Systems architecture; Internet of things","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159091064"

Based on a suitable set of measured data, this paper presents a novel practical methodology to create and automatically derive thermal models of existing buildings in high-fidelity simulators for energy management. To this end, the philosophy of grey-box strategies is followed to simplify the modeling and avoid the requirement of architectural metadata, facilitating and expediting the process. First, a building model with a highly reduced number of parameters is constructed by exploiting the existing similarities in the materials of the buildings and simplifying their elements to a simple one-layer parameterization. Then, the parameters of the derived model are iteratively updated while minimizing the error between the real temperature evolution and that generated by the model being identified. For this purpose, data of the room air temperature, estimated occupancy, weather conditions, and variables of the HVAC system are assumed to be available in suitable zones of the building to apply the creation and identification processes of the model, allowing that a whole digital twin of the building is constructed. The methodology is presented by its application to a real case study: the Nimbus Research Centre building at Munster Technological University, located in Cork (Ireland). The high-fidelity simulator software TRNSYS is used for the modeling task, together with the GenOpt optimization program. The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology yields a highly accurate model of the building, capable of representing reality with RMSE values consistently below 0.6C∘ during open-loop validation periods of up to four days. The findings suggest that this methodology may outperform other modeling techniques reported in the literature. Importantly, the proposed technique is less complex and time-consuming to implement than many of the alternatives. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automated model identification; Building energy efficiency; Building thermal model; Data-based grey-box modeling; Existing buildings; GenOpt; Simplified building modeling; TRNSYS","Buildings; Climate control; Computer software; Energy efficiency; Iterative methods; Thermography (temperature measurement); Automated model identification; Automated modelling; Building energy efficiency; Building model; Building Thermal models; Data-based gray-box modeling; Existing building; Genopt; Gray-box models; Grey-box models; Model identification; Simplified building modeling; TRNSYS; Metadata","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158864176"

However, because a large amount of multisource heterogeneous data and a real-time accurate prediction model are required to implement the process, the popularization and implementation of these technologies are hampered. Based on performance-based seismic design (PBSD) theory, this study introduces BIM and ontology and other emerging technologies to carry out methodology research on intelligent earthquake damage prediction and seismic performance evaluation for individual buildings. First, based on FEMA P-58 (Seismic Performance Assessment of Buildings), this paper uses BIM technology to integrate and transmit component-level engineering information. Ontology method is used to express the assessment content and logic, and a multidimensional semantic ontology model based on IFC is proposed to form the linked data foundation to organize, store, associate and interact the multisource heterogeneous data required for assessment in a unified way to realize the semi-automated seismic performance assessment for individual RC frame building. On this basis, the seismic optimization design under the guidance of the “investment - benefit” criterion is regarded as the problem of seeking the balance between the initial construction cost and the expectation of seismic loss. The multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used to realize the optimization iteration at the component level. According to the results of the case study, the new method in this paper significantly improves the quality of seismic performance assessment and seismic design optimization. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","FEMA P-58; IFC; Ontology; Seismic loss prediction; Seismic performance assessment","Architectural design; Earthquakes; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Iterative methods; Multiobjective optimization; Seismic design; Seismic waves; Semantics; FEMA P-58; IFC; Loss prediction; Multi-Sources; Ontology's; Optimization design; Seismic loss; Seismic loss prediction; Seismic performance assessment; Seismic performance evaluation; Ontology; building; dynamic analysis; earthquake damage; methodology; optimization; performance assessment; seismic design","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158843619"

In this study, a system to support operators by formalizing tacit knowledge was constructed based on the concept of Digital Triplet for the CAM process in mold manufacturing. The CAM process is the process of creating programs for machining molds using machine tools. This process is an important process related to accuracy and delivery time of molds. In this study, a generic description, process modeling language for Digital Triplet (PD3), was formulated to record the intelligent activities of operators as process models, based on the concept of Digital Triplet. The works of the CAM process were described as a process model by PD3, and an operator support system was built by implementing the process model.

However, there is a lack of systematic review studies in this area. This paper explored the factors and methods of risk assessment in hoisting for industrial building system (IBS) construction. Firstly, bibliometric analysis revealed that future research will focus on “ergonomics”, “machine learning”, “computer simulation”, and “wearable sensors”. Secondly, the previous 80 factors contributing to hoisting risks were summarized from a “human–equipment–management–material–environment” perspective, which can serve as a reference point for managers. Finally, we discussed, in-depth, the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and digital twins (DT). ANNs have improved the efficiency and accuracy of risk assessment. Still, they require high-quality and significant data, which traditional methods do not provide, resulting in the low accuracy of risk simulation results. DT data are emerging as an alternative, enabling stakeholders to visualize and analyze the construction process. However, DT’s interactivity, high cost, and information security need further improvement.

However, accurately and efficiently segmenting the point clouds of transmission corridors remains a challenging problem. Traditional segmentation methods for transmission corridors suffer from low accuracy and poor generalization ability, and the potential of deep learning in this field has been overlooked. Therefore, the PointNet++ deep learning model is employed as the backbone network for the segmentation of 3D point clouds in transmission corridors. Additionally, given the distinct distribution of key components, an end-to-end CA-PointNet++ architecture is proposed by integrating the Coordinate Attention (CA) module with PointNet++. This approach captures long-distance spatial contextual features and improves feature saliency for more precise segmentation. Furthermore, CA-PointNet++ is evaluated on a dataset of 3D point clouds collected by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) equipped with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) for inspecting transmission corridors. The results show that CA-PointNet++ achieved 93.7% overall accuracy (OA) and 67.4% mean Intersection over Union (mIoU).

First, a virtual model is established to mirror the vibration response of a physical entity using a dynamic modeling method. Second, the modeling method is validated through a frequency analysis of the generated signal. Then, based on the signal similarity indicator, a physical–virtual signal interaction method is proposed to dynamically update the virtual model in which parameter sensitivity analysis, surrogate technique, and optimization algorithm are applied to increase the efficiency during the model updating.

Various reasons for the low uptake in the construction industry are identified based on the construction professionals’ perspectives. However, the public perceptions toward modular construction have not been identified. To improve public perceptions, researchers recognised digital twin technologies, which is Building Information Modelling (BIM) among other technologies-as a potential solution to the current situation. However, the current public perception and the implication of BIM toward modular construction have been rarely researched. The research aims to explore if the use of BIM can improve public perceptions of modular construction and clients’ willingness to invest in a modular house. Research reveals that 52% of participants are aware of modular construction. However, the participants perceive a modular house as a container box with a kitchen and bathroom. Increasing design flexibility and customisation options are recognised as essential for improving the current perceptions. BIM is recognised as an essential digital twin technology to improve perceptions and increase clients’ willingness to invest in a modular house.

The use of structural health monitoring (SHM) systems integrating monitoring techniques as well as inspection and structural analyses has gained great relevance in the appearance of low-cost IoT (Internet of Things) sensors on the market. In this paper, an IoT BIM-based solution is presented for real-time monitoring using low-cost sensors in the scope of building SHM systems.

Additionally, this approach allows for forecasting and planning of future maintenance activities while avoiding errors in manual surveys interpretation. The methodology of this study consists of creating a 3D virtual model of an as-built building with the parameterization of its components, connecting relevant information to the service life of materials and installations in the construction. Thus, parametric tables were created with a list of components that make up the environment, their quantities, the year of application, and an estimated time for a specific item to present pathologies. It was observed that the created virtual model ensured that information was stored and managed, allowing for the creation of tables with NBR 15575 data related to the service life of materials, enabling the responsible professionals for building management to have access to parametric models with forecasts.

The assembly interference matrix represents two parts which are collision or not when they move along specific directions. Traditional assembly interference matrix construction adopts geometric collision detection on the approximate swept volume of parts which are composed by moving step by step. This not only leads to a heavy computational load because of the small moving steps but it is also easy to misjudge the contact as collision as well as missing collision due to discrete spatial movement of the part. To overcome these drawbacks, this work equivalent the collision detection of parts during the establishment of the assembly interference matrix as visibility judgment, and develops an image-assisted calculation method to process the collision between the part’s swept volume as the occlusion of images via computer graphics rendering.

A critical literature review of BDIT can contribute toward innovation for the AEC industry. In this study, a quantitative mapping of 247 BDIT literatures from 2017 to 2022 was conducted. Following the clue of quantitative work, two critical levels of technological development and application for BDIT were analyzed. The findings suggest: (1) the technological developments of BDIT may involve technological integration (i.e., integration of blockchain and internet of thing/building information modeling/edge computing) and knowledge framework; and (2) the technological applications of BDIT may involve information automation management and building information management. To further explore the trends of BDIT, some future evolutions (i.e., integration of blockchain and federated learning/digital twin/cloud-edge-end), application scenarios and challenges of BDIT were discussed.

As a typical cyber-physical system, the raise boring construction project is full of high heterogeneity, complexity and intrinsic uncertainty. Currently, its decision making loop is mainly based on the document-based system engineering and expertise experience. Regarding the intrinsic invisibility and uncertain risks in the underground engineering, especially for the remotely underground constructions on the extraterrestrial planets, it is absolutely required to shift the document-based and experience-dependent decision making paradigm into a digital and smart way. To this end, a systematic framework of the digital twin-driven process planning system for the raise boring method was conceived and presented. Then following the principles of open architecture, modularization and extensibility, a five-dimension architecture of digital twinning was built comprehensively that contained physical entity, digital representation, service entity, cross-systems entity and connection entity. Furthermore, a digital twin-driven decision making prototype system for the raise boring process was developed by the hybrid modeling of data-based model, visual geometric models, domain knowledge-based model and physics-based model. System verification indicated that the presented system had great potentials to facilitate the already very complicated process planning via the planning recommendation, visual simulation and models fusion. Finally, the contributions, novelty and limitations of this endeavour to extend the current digital twin practice were discussed. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin; Hybrid modeling; Process planning; Raise boring method; Underground construction","Computer architecture; Construction equipment; Domain Knowledge; Embedded systems; Modular construction; Process planning; Construction projects; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Decisions makings; Document-based; Hybrid model; Pilot holes; Raise boring method; Underground construction; Underground infrastructure; Decision making","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127969748"

These Contemporary Software Systems (CSS) add new challenges for their construction, maintainability, and evolution, including the involvement of many actors with the software project and the necessary management of dependencies among hardware/things, software systems, and people. Problem: These technological challenges jeopardize the final quality of modern information systems due to the lack of adequate mechanisms supporting the engineering of CSS. Solution: Continuous Experimentation (CE) deserves some investigation regarding its suitability to mitigate and reduce engineering CSS risks. IS Theory: This research is under the General Systems Theory and is consistent with the Systems Information challenges regarding building smart cities-based systems. Method: To undertake a Structured Literature Review (StLR) supported with snowballing to reveal CE’s empirical studies. Results: The StLR identified seven primary studies on CE adoption to support CSS building. Many studies are in the domain of embedded systems and CPS. Besides, the findings allowed us to conjecture a set of challenges and opportunities regarding using CE in CSS engineering. Conclusion: There are emergent technologies to support CE’s execution in the context of web-based systems. However, several challenges and gaps surround CE’s use for engineering CSS. Furthermore, the lack of software technologies, blueprints, or concrete guidance to promote CE in these software systems can motivate further investigations into its use in engineering the important parts of modern information systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Continuous Experimentation; Evidence-Based Software Engineering; Industry 4.0; Literature Review","Blueprints; Computer software; Industry 4.0; Information systems; Information use; Project management; Smart city; Continuous experimentation; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Embedded-system; Evidence Based Software Engineering; Literature reviews; Software project; Software systems risks; Software-systems; Technological challenges; Embedded systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166029896"

Therefore, a high level of communication and coordination of all stakeholders and tasks is required for successful hospital management, starting with the planning of the building and especially for the utilization phase. This paper presents the opportunities and challenges of the digital method Building Information Modelling (BIM) in hospital construction for the building management to improve the health care service management. The relevant background information regarding BIM in general, hospital projects in which BIM has been applied, etc. was obtained by literature research. Based on background information obtained by literature research about BIM and the application in hospitals, guided interviews were conducted to determine the opportunities and challenges of BIM in hospital construction. In this process experts from the healthcare sector were interviewed who had already gained experience with the BIM application in single pilot projects. The evaluation of the interviews was carried out with qualitative content analysis according to Mayring. Although BIM is applied as a digital method in construction industry, the benefits go beyond the construction perspective. A BIM model provides the necessary infrastructure to advance the digitalization of hospital services. The digital twin of the building can be considered as basis therefore. Besides the opportunities for the hospital building, there are presented possibilities in the utilization for health care service based on the BIM model, e.g. automated disinfection of door handles in the building. However, there are also challenges for the implementation and application of BIM, as for example the model needs to be constantly maintained by qualified personnel in order to ensure reliability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BIM; Building Information Modeling; Digitalization in Hospitals; Hospital Construction","Architectural design; Construction; Construction industry; Health care; Information theory; Background information; Building Information Modelling; Building management; Digital methods; Digitalization in hospital; Healthcare services; Hospital construction; Hospital management; Literature researches; Hospitals","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178052906"

However, due to its interdisciplinary nature, the relevant documents on IC are diverse and fragmented. To provide a comprehensive understanding of research progress and future opportunities in IC and to offer suggestions for both developing and developed countries, this study employed VOSviewer and Gephi to conduct a comparative review of relevant literature from the 21st century. A keyword search of Web of Science (WOS) identified 2788 relevant documents which were subjected to an overall co-citation and co-authorship analysis. To illustrate the differences between developing and developed countries, China, a representative developing country, was taken as the candidate to be compared with developed countries via a co-occurrence analysis. Differences between China and developed countries in the three sub-directions of IC, research foundation and domain knowledge transformation; information perception, fusion, and decision making; and embodied AI, were qualitatively discussed. Finally, four future research directions were suggested: (1) data fusion and decision-making, (2) improving the accuracy and efficiency of knowledge representation, learning, and utilization, (3) the establishment of large, pre-trained models in the field, and (4) embodied AI for taking actions according to the decisions made. This paper provides an overview of the relevant literature and the IC context for practitioners and scholars in the AEC industry in countries with different levels of development, as well as suggestions for the future development of IC.

However, it is challenging to evaluate their performance due to limitations such as data deficiency, human error, etc. Thus, this paper proposes an approach to data-driven quantitative performance evaluation of construction supervisors by integrating an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and activity tracking. The proposed approach contains three parts, namely, index extraction, weighting, data-driven index calculation, and then validation by case study. Firstly, performance indexes were developed based on a literature review as well as surveys and function analysis of the information system for construction supervision (CSI system). Then, the weights of and relationships among of the indexes are determined by AHP. After that, with daily workflow and inspection activities tracked in the CSI system, a method and a software module for automatic calculation of indexes were developed. Lastly, the proposed approach was validated by a real-world case.

This study aims to develop a BIM and IoT data fusion framework to facilitate the appropriate data process flow for various applications. To investigate the research topic, an integrative review was conducted. Specifically, a general and tailored four-step data fusion process model was proposed as the review's guiding framework. Critical evaluations were incorporated into a road map to provide a comprehensive perspective of BIM and IoT data fusion. In addition, based on the findings, a two-level and interconnected data fusion framework was proposed, which illustrates the data process flow and differentiates the data abstraction level, data processing technologies and purpose of the fusion.

This work explores the digital twin of EIoT (EIoT-DT) and then provides a novel data-driven SA paradigm, named DT-SA, as a promising alternative. Based on the combination of the latest data technologies and machine learning algorithms, DT-SA transfers those stubborn SA challenges to digital space, and then addresses them by building a domain-specific and data-friendly digital twin (DT) model upon massive data. The established model can be quantitatively tested via iterative virtual-real interaction and, thus, be evaluated and updated through closed-loop feedback to improve its performance in the physical world. To this end, some engineering and scientific problems are raised: 1) virtual-real interaction mechanism relevant to resource flow and data flow; 2) unified modeling and analysis of heterogeneous spatial-temporal data; 3) DT configuration and evolution; and 4) domain-specific DT-SA characterization. To solve these problems, cloud-edge-terminal configuration, big data analytics (BDA), DT, and SA indicator systems are studied, respectively. Then, the random matrix theory (RMT) and overarching DT-SA framework are designed as a roadmap. Besides, some potential applications and undergoing projects on the terminal, edge, or cloud are discussed, e.g., condition assessment of equipment, digital monitoring and diagnosis of the power grid network, and EIoT construction in the smart city. Finally, some perspectives and recommendations are proposed in conclusion for future research.

In this article, we identify three requirements (fidelity, efficiency, and flexibility) for performance evaluation. Then we present a comparison of selected data-driven methods and investigate their potential trends in data, models, and applications. We find that performance models have enabled extensive applications, while there are still significant conflicts between models' capacities to handle diversified inputs and limited data collected from the production network. We further illustrate the opportunities for data collection, model construction, and application prospects.

The networked air traffic management (ATM) system is an integrated space–air–ground network integrating communication, network, satellite, and data chain technology, which adopts a network-centric structure to provide network-enabled services and applications for the air transportation system. In view of the serious network threats faced by networked ATM, this paper studies the basic theories and key technologies of ATM information security assurance and designs a credible security architecture to provide comprehensive and systematic security assurance for networked ATM. Starting from the problems and development trend of ATM security assurance, this paper investigates the dynamic and complex data processing process of ATM system, analyzes the complex interaction between its cyber and physical system, and then constructs the networked ATM cyber–physical fusion system model and threat model. Furthermore, the causal relationship between ATM security threat alert information is mapped into a Bayesian network, and the game model of networked ATM is proposed using Bayesian Nash equilibrium strategy. At last, the information security assurance architecture of networked ATM system based on blockchain technology is formed by establishing a distributed co-trust mechanism and multi-chain storage structure. We expect this paper to bring some inspiration to the related research in academia and aviation so as to provide useful reference for the construction of ATM safety and security system and the development of technology. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","air traffic management (ATM); blockchain; cyber security; cyber–physical system (CPS); information security assurance","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152920374"

Crucial in the use of robots in a built environment is their capacity to locate themselves and navigate as autonomously as possible. Robots often rely on planar and 3D laser scanners for that purpose, and building information models (BIM) are seldom used, for a number of reasons, namely their unreliability, unavailability, and mismatch with localization algorithms used in robots. However, while BIM models are becoming increasingly reliable and more commonly available in more standard data formats (JSON, XML, RDF), they become more promising and reliable resources for localization and indoor navigation, in particular in the more static types of existing infrastructure (existing buildings). In this article, we specifically investigate to what extent and how such building data can be used for such robot navigation. Data flows are built from BIM model to local repository and further to the robot, making use of graph data models (RDF) and JSON data formats. The local repository can hereby be considered to be a digital twin of the real-world building. Navigation on the basis of a BIM model is tested in a real world environment (university building) using a standard robot navigation technology stack. We conclude that it is possible to rely on BIM data and we outline different data flows from BIM model to digital twin and to robot. Future work can focus on (1) making building data models more reliable and standard (modelling guidelines and robot world model), (2) improving the ways in which building features in the digital building model can be recognized in 3D point clouds observed by the robots, and (3) investigating possibilities to update the BIM model based on robot feedback. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3D geometry; Buildings; Indoor navigation; Linked data; Robot navigation; Semantics","Architectural design; Data flow analysis; Data transfer; Indoor positioning systems; Linked data; Navigation; Resource Description Framework (RDF); Robots; 3D geometry; Building Information Modelling; Built environment; Construction sites; Data transfer methods; Dataflow; Indoor navigation; Linked datum; Robot navigation; Semantic data; Semantics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151554151"

To address such an issue, this paper proposes a low-complexity and flexible factory operation model, the smart fractal factory (SFF). First, we propose the model definition of the cyber–physical fractal (CPF) based on fractal theory, whose information composition and evolution mechanism are used to formally describe the multi-scale self-similarity of structural characteristics and the operation mode of the smart manufacturing system. The core of the CPF is essential information element (EIEs) and typical information flow (TIFs), which are critical to upgrading manufacturing capabilities intelligently. Second, considering the realizability of the CPF pattern, the attribute configuration of EIEs and the operation mechanism of TIFs are established. Among them, self-organizing, self-adaptation, and self-learning TIFs are utilized for the construction of resource collaboration relationships, the evaluation and optimization of dynamic collaboration, and the enhancement of autonomous analysis or decision-making capabilities. Then, by leveraging agent modeling technology, we present a CPF implementation method to encapsulate distributed resources intelligently and homogeneously into smart manufacturing units that can autonomously optimize and collaborate. Thus, the multilayered architecture of traditional factories in the industrial Internet environment is transformed into an intelligent collaboration architecture based on CPF clusters in the SFF system. Finally, the usability and effectiveness of SFF were verified in a real manufacturing case of a customized product. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Customized products; Cyber physical production system; Fractal theory; Multi-agent system; Smart factory","Cyber Physical System; Decision making; Flow control; Fractals; Information management; Customized products; Cybe physical production system; Cyber physicals; Fractal theory; Information flows; Manufacturing units; Physical fractals; Production system; Smart factory; Smart manufacturing; Multi agent systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147333517"

Because the gears are usually in high-speed operation, their key components are subject to severe wear and impact damage. When the gearbox is subjected to a failure, it is often difficult to judge the operating status of the gearbox in real time. Since the gearbox system is complex, moreover, it is still difficult for the simulation model to accurately identify the gearbox fault. To address this issue, this paper proposes a digital twin-based signal fusion model to accurately identify gearbox faults at the signal level. The proposed model can identify minor faults occurring in planetary gearboxes by fusing actual and virtual signals. Firstly, on the basis of virtual prototype and the multibody dynamics software, a digital physical model based on Hertz theory and extended finite element method is proposed for gearbox dynamic monitoring and digital simulation, in which the gearbox can be visualized. Secondly, the data-driven method is used to extract and select features from real and simulation signals, and the fault of the planetary gearbox is detected by feature matching. Finally, the real and simulation signals are fused effectively based on variational mode decomposition and phase correction of generalized cross-correlation coefficient. The fault diagnosis result of the gearbox is finally determined by using the envelope spectrum of the fused signal. The experimental results show that the virtual real fusion method effectively improves the performance of the traditional signal diagnosis methods, and the fusion of the actual and virtual signals strengthens the fault features of the fused signals effectively. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin; Fault diagnosis; Gearbox; Vibration signal; Virtual reality fusion","Computer software; Electric power transmission; Fault detection; Gears; Variational mode decomposition; Virtual addresses; Virtual prototyping; Virtual reality; Wind power; Data-driven methods; Faults diagnosis; Fusion model; Gearbox; Physical modelling; Planetary gearboxes; Real signals; Vibration signal; Virtual reality fusion; Virtual signals; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144090054"

Modeling and simulation techniques are widely used for reducing the time and cost for commercialization of these new devices. Real time digital simulators (RTDS) and Power Hardware in the Loop simulations (PHILS) are representative [1-4]. Simulation performed on a RTDS using design program such as RSCAD has been stabilized for the past 20 years and has reached a level that operates almost same as real grid. However, although this existing test method with RTDS is relatively efficient compared to the actual implementation in the construction environment, RTDS is still tend to be expensive. PHILS, which verifies power device by mixing RTDS and power hardware, is more complex and expensive. Tests related to power device verification need to be performed effectively in terms of time and cost. Therefore, in this paper, we propose hierarchical validation process structured in consisting of four stages. First, in a test using digital twin (DT), a normal operation of the power device is verified using an AI model and a physical model. Second, in the RTDS test, simulated grid events such as islanding not occurred before in the environment are simulated for stability analysis. Third, in the PHILS test, all or part of the power device is built with PHILS to verify stability.

Given the unsynchronized nature and heterogeneous sampling rates of distributed sensing processes, the varying time misalignment among different attributes will inevitably deteriorate the remote correlation analysis and digital twin construction. Furthermore, application-agnostic digital twin construction approaches could potentially involve high communication and computation overhead for comprehensive digital twin construction. In this article, a concurrent end-to-end time synchronization and multi-attribute data resampling scheme is proposed to enable accurate and efficient digital twin construction at the remote end. Specifically, digital clocks are concurrently established at the remote end, with each of them associated with a sampling rate of a unique sensing attribute. To tackle the temporal misalignment among multiple sensing attributes, raw data are accurately resampled according to the same reference frequency, with attribute-specific synchronized digital clocks providing cohesively aligned time information. An edge-centric platform is established to efficiently guide the multidimensional data processing during digital twin construction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve more accurate and efficient digital twin construction than existing modeling methods.

Traditional hands-on training is resource and labor intensive, whereas virtual training, such as video demonstrations, cannot provide trainees with egocentric kinesthetic or proprioceptive experience such as muscular engagement. It is important to develop remote training methods that can provide rich sensory feedback and leverage the trainee's proprioception. This paper proposes a novel remote motor skill training system that can transfer experts' kinematic and kinesthetic experience, including both positional and force experience, to novice trainees by using virtual reality (VR) and a robot arm without the physical presence of the experts. The system uses VR to simulate virtual operation scenarios and interactions to provide an immersive operation experience. The robotic system records experts' kinematic and kinesthetic patterns and trains novices with perceptual learning. The system design was demonstrated with a welding training task. A welding simulator was built with a Unity engine and a seven-degrees-of-freedom robot arm, which provided high-fidelity welding experience and could actively guide welding trainees. It was found that the welding simulator was resilient to external disturbance and provided accurate feedback and guidance.

However, the effect of COVID-19 on clients and construction companies put high pressure on construction managers to seek digital solutions and justified the need for remote operating or distant controlling technologies. This paper aims to investigate the state of play in construction technology implementation and presents a roadmap for developing and implementing required technologies for the construction industry. The COVID-19 disruption required new methods of working safely and remotely and coincided with the advent of advanced automation and autonomous technologies. This paper aims to identify gaps and 11 disruptive technologies that may lead to upheaval and transformation of the construction sector, perhaps in this decade. A road map for technology implementation can be helpful in developing business strategies at the organizational level as a theoretical measure, and it can facilitate the technology implementation process at the industry level as a practical measure. The roadmap can be used as a framework for policymakers to set industry or company strategies for the next 10 years (2030). © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BIM; construction industry; convergence technology; COVID-19; digital solutions; digital twin; Industry 4.0; virtual reality","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149247504"

A lack of technology makes the ready-mix concrete (RMC) industry suffer from frequent production failures, ultimately causing high customer dissatisfaction and loss of revenues. In this paper, we propose the first-ever digital twin (DT) system in the RMC industry that can serve as a decision support tool to manage production risk efficiently and effectively via predictive maintenance. This study focuses on the feasibility of digital twins for the RMC industry in three main areas holistically: (1) the technical feasibility of the digital twin system for ready-mix concrete plant production risk management; (2) the business value of the proposed product to the construction industry; (3) the challenges of implementation in the real-world RMC industry. The proposed digital twin system consists of three main phases: (1) an IoT system to get the real-time production cycle times; (2) a digital twin operational working model with descriptive analytics; (3) an advanced analytical dashboard with predictive analytics to make predictive maintenance decisions. Our proposed digital twin solution can provide efficient and interpretable predictive maintenance insights in real time based on anomaly detection, production bottleneck identification, process disruption forecast and cycle time analysis. Finally, this study emphasizes that state-of-the-art solutions such as digital twins can effectively manage the production risks of ready-mix concrete plants by automatically detecting and predicting the bottlenecks without waiting until a production failure happens to react. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","anomaly detection; digital twin; multi-method simulation; predictive maintenance; ready-mix concrete production; risk management","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149203304"

Due to the dynamics of the subsea environment such as uncertain turbulences, affected visibility and interference with subsea ecosystems, control of subsea ROV is challenging for human operators, especially for construction professionals who have never been exposed to such an environment. The traditional visual feedback method can hardly provide direct and intuitive cues about workplace uncertainties, especially the flow conditions, which makes the ROV operation a work with a high mental load and high training barrier. To augment human sensation of the ROV and workplace status, this research proposes a hierarchical intuitive control method based on Virtual Reality (VR) and haptic simulators. A distributed sensor system that allows a flexible add-on sensor package for subsea environmental data collection is applied to the ROVs to collect hydrodynamic data of subsea workplaces. Then, a Digital Twins (DT) module receives and integrates all data to drive a simulation approach for data augmentation. Last, multi-level sensory feedback methods, including far-field augmented 3D visual feedback, near-field haptic suit tactile feedback, and micro-field haptic suit turbulence feedback are generated and sent to human operators through haptic devices. Compared to previous studies, this system reconstructs the realistic subsea environment with detailed hydrodynamic features in VR digital twin. Whole-body level haptic feedback is realized based on hydrodynamic information. This proposed system ensures an immersive awareness of the proximity conditions and predictions of potential damage and status changes during ROV operations. As a result, a less-trained operator can pilot the ROV based on intuition to maximize the performance and avoid potential mistakes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Haptics; Remotely operated vehicles; Subsea operation; Virtual reality","Data acquisition; Digital storage; Feedback; Hydrodynamics; Remote control; Remotely operated vehicles; Sensory feedback; Turbulence; Visual communication; Construction operations; Ecosystem control; Haptics; Human operator; Robot teleoperation; Sensory augmentations; Sub-sea operations; Subsea environment; Vehicle operations; Visual feedback; Virtual reality","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144457196"

However, using digital models to reflect the structural performance of physical assets usually faces high computational costs, which makes it difficult for the model to satisfy real-time requirements. As a technique to replace expensive simulations, surrogate models have great potential to solve this problem. In practice, however, the optimal individual surrogate model (ISM) applicable to a given problem usually changes as factors change, and this can be mitigated by integrating multiple ISMs. Therefore, this paper proposes a scalable digital twin framework based on a novel adaptive ensemble surrogate model. This ensemble not only provides robust approximation but also reduces the additional cost brought by the ensemble by reducing the number of ISMs participating in the ensemble through multicriterion model screening. Moreover, based on the characteristics of the finite element method, a node rearrangement method, which provides scalability for the construction of a digital model, is proposed. That is, the distribution and number of nodes can be customized to not only decrease the computational cost by reducing nodes but also obtain the information at key positions by customizing the locations of nodes. Numerical experiments are employed to verify the performance of the proposed ensemble and node rearrangement method. A telehandler is used as an example to build a scalable digital twin, which proves the feasibility and effectiveness of the framework. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adaptive ensemble of surrogate models; design automation; digital twin; node rearrangement; scalability; telehandler","Computer aided design; Cost reduction; Numerical methods; Adaptive ensemble of surrogate model; Computational costs; Design automations; Digital modeling; Node rearrangement; Physical assets; Real- time; Structural performance; Surrogate modeling; Telehandlers; Scalability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144261802"

However, disruptions in production can negate the advantages of modular construction. Dynamic scheduling (DS) is the strategic handling of production disruptions where real-time events' effects are mitigated by analyzing the state of the production system and automatically optimizing production planning. The prerequisite for DS is acquiring real-time data relevant to production planning. Thus, the digital capturing, evaluation, and provision of production-relevant data are needed. This paper develops a Digital Twin (DT) of a production system based on the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), known as the implementation of DT in Industry 4.0. The AAS of the production system serves as a virtual aggregation level for the relevant data. DS is implemented using a simulation-based scheduler. The presented approach is verified using a virtual production system for precast concrete modules as a proof of concept. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Industry 4.0; Construction method; Dynamic scheduling; Efficient construction; Modulars; Pre-cast; Production Planning; Production system; Real- time; Real-time data; Time event; Concrete industry","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207161443"

A digital twin (DT) is a virtual replica of assets that provides valuable insights into real-time simulation, and monitoring. In this regard, laser scanners have become a critical component in the creation of DTs for built environments, owing to their ability to capture highly accurate point clouds of scenes. This paper presents an automatic algorithm for the creation of digital building twins with rich semantics and coherent geometry from the dense RGB point cloud. The proposed method aligns the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) methods in scene understanding with domain knowledge to overcome the data challenges.

Living systems in nature demonstrate extraordinary scalable efficiencies in adaptive construction with simple flexible parts made from sustainable materials. The interdisciplinary field of collective robotic construction (CRC) inspired by natural builders has begun to demonstrate potential for scalable, adaptive, resilient, and low-cost solutions for building construction with simple robots. Yet, to explore the opportunities inspired by natural systems, CRC systems must be developed utilizing artificial intelligence for collaborative and adaptive construction, which has yet to be explored. Autonomous Collaborative Robotic Reconfiguration (ACRR) is a robotic material system with an adaptive lifecycle trained with deep, multi-agent reinforcement learning (DMARL) for collaborative reconfiguration. Autonomous Collaborative Robotic Reconfiguration is implemented through three interrelated components codesigned in relation to each other: 1) a reconfigurable robotic material system; 2) a cyber-physical simulation, sensing, and control system; and 3) a framework for collaborative robotic intelligence with DMARL. The integration of the CRC system with bidirectional cyber-physical control and collaborative intelligence enables ACRR to operate as a scalable and adaptive architectural eco-system. It has the potential not only to transform how we design and build architecture, but to fundamentally change our relationship to the built environment moving from automated toward autonomous construction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Adaptive control systems; Autonomous agents; Climate change; Computer aided design; Cyber Physical System; Deep learning; Flexible structures; Intelligent robots; Life cycle; Multi agent systems; Collective robotics; Construction systems; Cyber physicals; ECO systems; Material systems; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Physical control; Reconfigurable; Robotic construction; Simple++; Reinforcement learning","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192862000"

A BESS has to be assessed for risks because thermal runaways from LIBs can occur. Both hazards and risk assessment of a BESS were conducted; however, the comprehensive identification of risk scenarios and the system-level risk assessments are challenging due to the interaction between multiple components inside the BESS. Thus, in this study, we focus on multiphysics system-level modeling of a LIB module and perform simulations via a model constructed using Modelica. Modelica is an equation-based, object-oriented modeling language that allows the acausal modeling of complex cyber-physical systems. First, we created a multiphysics system-level model of a large-format LIB module using several helpful assumptions. Then, we validated the model by comparing the temperature profiles of each LIB in the module (under different initial conditions) with those reported in the literature. Finally, we applied the model for the LIB module with some case studies, including a dynamic quantitative analysis of hazardous scenarios and quantitative risk analysis. The results of this study can help improve the conventional risk assessment process of BESSs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Battery energy storage system; Multiphysics system-level modeling; Risk analysis; Thermal runaway","Embedded systems; Hazards; Lithium-ion batteries; Modeling languages; Renewable energy; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Battery energy storage systems; Battery modules; Electric power; ITS applications; Modelica; Multiphysic system-level modeling; Multiphysics systems; Risks assessments; System-level modeling; Thermal runaways; Risk analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192496391"

The moon's weightlessness, extreme temperature differences, space radiation, and other factors make unmanned work on the lunar surface difficult. Construction on the lunar surface requires less rework than on the Earth's surface because of construction and transportation costs, and simulation on the ground using a digital twin is necessary. However, the lunar surface is covered by regolith with poor image and shape features, making it difficult to apply conventional image measurement and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). In this study, we investigated a surveying method using LiDAR-SLAM with a marker position. We also proposed a scaling method (LiDAR-SfM/MVS) for point clouds acquired by structure from motion and multi-view stereo (SfM/MVS) using the location of markers acquired by LiDAR-SLAM. In our experiment, regolith and sunlight were simulated with silica sand and xenon lamps in a space exploration field simulating the lunar surface. The experiment was conducted in a simulated lunar environment. The following process is used to obtain a high-density point cloud. First, an SfM/MVS point cloud is generated from images taken by a high-resolution camera. Next, a high-density colored point cloud with scale information is acquired by registering it with the SfM point cloud using the positions of sphere markers obtained from the LiDAR point cloud. Through our experiment, we confirmed that LiDAR-SfM/MVS can be used to acquire colored high-density point clouds even for objects with poor geometrical features by using markers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","LiDAR-SLAM; Lunar Survey; Point Clouds; SfM/MVS","Optical radar; Remote sensing; Robotics; Silica; Space applications; LiDAR-simultaneous localization and mapping; Lunar surface; Lunar survey; Multi-view stereo; Point-clouds; Research activities; Simultaneous localization and mapping; Structure from motion; Structure from motion and multi-view stereo; Surface development; Space research","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191257865"

This study advanced a framework for using Digital Twins for civil infrastructure, which could be applied to various assets. This paper applied the framework to the historic Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol (UK). This aim was achieved through the following objectives: (i) proposing a working framework applicable to various assets; (ii) applying the framework and developing the physical-virtual architecture for the case study of the Clifton Suspension Bridge (Bristol); (iii) reflecting and drawing lessons from the application. The novelty of this work consists in illustrating the step-by-step framework of twinning, which is not limited to a methodological perspective nor to a particular asset of civil infrastructure. In addition to the theoretical contribution, this work’s importance also includes the case study itself, which ultimately offers a needed demonstration of the concept of digital twinning. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Suspension bridges; Case-studies; Civil infrastructures; Development stages; Engineering sectors; Maintenance designs; Optimisations; Performance; Virtual architecture; Cost engineering","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186688617"

Regular use and the effects of time can affect the behavior of a structure. Therefore, the condition assessment of these assets is one of the most critical issues for infrastructure operators, aiding bridge integrity management. The present paper aims to study the dynamic structural responses and the soil-structure interaction of a reinforced concrete (RC) railway bridge. For this study, a sixspan reinforced concrete bridge with 180 meters in total length, built in the 80s and rehabilitated in 2017, was employed as a case study. The bridge superstructure contains longitudinal beams with rectangular cross-sections, transverse beams, and a concrete deck with variable cross-sections. The infrastructure is composed of caissons supported by a rock layer. A numerical model was developed using the finite element method considering the soilstructure interaction process from Winkler springs calibrated adequately according to soil characteristics and foundation type. The springs, applied on the foundations and bearing devices, were positioned according to design and construction information, which provided physical and mechanical characteristics necessary to develop the computational modeling. Results regarding natural frequencies of vibration, deformations, displacements, accelerations, and velocities in the deck, beams, and pile caps of the railway bridge were analyzed and compared with monitoring results, assessing the bridge’s structural response when subjected to dynamic loads. The numerical results adhered to those found in the monitoring campaign, thus validating the modeling methodology strategy employed in the bridge study. The results can be used to evaluate the structural condition and asses the bridge’s behavior during its life cycle. Therefore, it can support the development of models to predict failures and even be incorporated into a digital twin that can be employed for bridge integrity management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Deterioration; Dynamic loads; Life cycle; Numerical methods; Piles; Railroad bridges; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Soil structure interactions; Soils; Structural design; Vibration analysis; Computational analysis; Condition assessments; Critical issues; Effect of time; Integrity management; Material conditions; Railway bridges; Railway infrastructure; Soil-structure interaction; Support conditions; Reinforced concrete","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186670422"

Continuous condition monitoring is essential to ensure the safe and economical use of the structures until the end of their life cycle. Predictive maintenance can be implemented using modern information and communication technologies such as the digital twin (DT) combined with structural health monitoring methods. DTs are virtual real-time representations of structures that collect, evaluate, and provide data for informed decision-making. However, a unified approach still needs to be developed for application in the civil engineering domain. This paper proposes a concept to implement modular DT for bridge structures based on the linked data approach.

For the application in construction practice, the paper gives a short introduction of the Digital Twin theory, describes the different elements of a Digital Twin, and discusses the different tasks, which have to be addressed within the life cycle. Based on this, an approach to structure, harmonize, and integrate heterogeneous data is presented. The key element is the definition and exhaustive implementation of a project data structure which is applied to all elements within a 3D-model an all other data sources. This approach allows to “glue” data from multiple sources and to access filtered results. Finally, the paper presents the realization of a Digital Twin. For this purpose a German highway project operated in a public private partnership with a length of 47 km is introduced. The Digital Twin integrates data from different sources like roadway inspections, mobile status monitoring, traffic data, weather data, and 3D model data.

However, those trip planners may not truly be multimodal to vulnerable road users (VRU)s since those selected sidewalk routes may not be accessible or feasible for people with disability. Depending on the level of availability of digital twin of travelers behaviors and sidewalk inventory, providing the personalized suggestion about the sidewalk with route features coupled with transit service reliability could be useful and happier transit riders may boost public transit demand/funding and reduce rush hour congestion. In this paper, the adaptive trip planner considers the real-time impact of environment changes on pedestrian route choice preferences (e.g., fatigue, weather conditions, unexpected construction, road congestion) and tolerance level in response to transit service uncertainty. Sidewalk inventory is integrated in directed hypergraph on the General Transit Feed Specification to specify traveler utilities as weights on the hyperedge. A realistic assessment of the effect of the user-defined preferences on a traveler's path choice is presented for a section of the Boston transit network, with schedule data from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. Different maximum utility values are presented as a function of varying travelers risk-tolerance levels. In response to unprecedented climate change, poverty, and inflation, this new trip planner can be adopted by state agencies to boost their existing public transit demand without extra efforts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Intelligent systems; Motor transportation; Pavements; Traffic congestion; Transportation routes; Urban transportation; 'current; First mile; Last-mile connectivity; Multi-modal; Optimal dynamics; People with disabilities; Public transit; Road users; Tolerance levels; Transit demand; Climate change","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186507109"

The resulting digital twins of the real environment are suitable for developing and validating connected and automated driving functions and for increasing the operational safety of intelligent vehicles by providing ITS-S real-time data. However, ITS-Ss are very costly to establish and operate. The choice of sensor technology also has an impact on the overall costs as well as on the data quality. So far, there is only insufficient knowledge about the concrete expenses that arise with the construction of different ITS-S setups. Within this work, multiple modular infrastructure sensor setups are investigated with the help of a life cycle cost analysis (LCCA). Their economic efficiency, different user requirements and sensor data qualities are considered. Based on the static cost model, a Monte Carlo simulation is performed, to generate a range of possible project costs and to quantify the financial risks of implementing ITS-S projects of different scales. Due to its modularity, the calculation model is suitable for diverse applications and outputs a distinctive evaluation of the underlying cost-benefit ratio of investigated setups. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Cost benefit analysis; Economic analysis; Economic efficiency; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Life cycle; Monte Carlo methods; Automated driving; Data quality; Driving functions; Economics analysis; Intelligent transportation systems; Operational safety; Real environments; Real-time data; Sensor technologies; Traffic nodes; Roadsides","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186498406"

Such installations usually include facilities for research in areas such as astronomy and high-energy physics. The research infrastructure is a complex of construction facilities, engineering systems, precise control and measuring equipment, characterized by high complexity and strict requirements for all operational parameters. In addition, these facilities are associated with high operating costs, are sensitive to minor changes in their condition and environmental conditions, and carry the risk of data loss during long-term and unique experiments.

To overcome this, we introduce the ""Digital Human Interaction based on Mono Camera""method. This approach simulates full-body human actions using an easily accessible mono camera.

DT is regarded as the digital representation of physical entities to mirror their state and behavior in the virtual space. The development of modeling and simulation technology makes the construction of DT professional and systematic. A lot of modeling methods and virtual models for DT construction are accumulated. However, the value of existing scattered models is not fully considered. These models could be used as virtual resources for the DT construction to save time and costs. Therefore, this paper proposes an ontology-based approach to support the configuration of Shop-floor Digital Twin (SDT). The ontologies are defined based on the analysis of the multi-domain heterogeneous models and knowledge. The top-level ontology is represented as the demand-oriented integration view of SDT.

This can include assets such as buildings, transportation systems, and more. Digital twins can be created through the integration of various data types such as sensor data, CAD designs, and other sources. A digital twin of a university campus is a digital replica of the physical university campus that can be used for various purposes, such as planning and design, asset management, operations and maintenance, security, and sustainability. The digital twin can be created using a combination of data from various sources, such as sensors, cameras, Building Information Models (BIM), Drone, and internet of things (IoT) devices. These datasets is then combined to create a real-time, 3D model of the university campus that can be used to simulate various scenarios and assess the impact of changes and improvements. In this project, several datasets were collected including a large-scale topographic map, building heights, and building elevations images. Then, the Digital twin design was carried out using numerous 3D modelling software systems. ArcGIS Pro was used in identifying and highlighting the structures such as building, streets and trees, which were defined as the main features of the project given the scale of the model. Then, City engine was used to produce a digital twin. This was also further developed using Unreal Engine to form a model that is as close to real life as possible. This engine is used in video games to create cities and mimic a real lively environment. Then, a Virtual Reality (VR) model of the University City was created. Such a model allowed for better understanding of the space and enabled for higher level of visualization. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3D model; Building Information Models (BIM); Digital twin; GIS","Architectural design; Computer aided design; Digital devices; Engines; Geographic information systems; Information theory; Internet of things; Large datasets; Maps; Sustainable development; Virtual reality; 3D models; 3d-modeling; Building information model; Building Information Modelling; Built environment; Case-studies; Physical assets; Simulation analysis; Transportation system; University campus; 3D modeling","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184145305"

These often-conflicting drivers have the potential to disrupt a project, if not managed carefully, leading to delays, cost over-run, conflict and sub-optimal outcomes. The Ngā Ūranga ki Pito-One Project comprises a 4.5 km shared pathway between Ngā Ūranga and Pito-One in Te Whanganui-a-Tara, Wellington. The Project will be located on the seaward side of the state highway and the rail corridor and will provide safe walking and cycling infrastructure and enhance the transport corridor's resilience. The Project includes all of the above-mentioned drivers including partner and stakeholder expectations, very tight environmental and ecological constraints, budget expectations, a difficult design environment adjacent to a major fault-line and exposed to southerly wind and wave climates, limited local rock supply and construction workspace. Delivery of the Project from concept design through to construction is being delivered by the Te Ara Tupua Alliance, comprised of owners Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency, working in partnership with mana whenua (Indigenous partners), contractors HEB and Downer and designers Tonkin + Taylor. To address the many project challenges, an innovative approach to design was implemented during initial concept phases. This included an agile design philosophy with sprint design and review cycles enabling fast paced integration of design, construction, environmental and cultural objectives. This approach included several innovations in the final design, most notably the adoption of modified XblocPlus® concrete armour units for primary armouring. These single-layer, pattern-placed units are to be used for the first time in Australasia and have resulted in significant cost and programme savings to the Project, but have also included bespoke modifications to achieve improved aesthetic, ecological and cultural outcomes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","agile; coastal structure; cultural; digital twin; ecology; landscape","Armor; Budget control; Design; Agile; Coastal structures; Cultural; Delay costs; Design approaches; Infrastructure project; Innovative design; Landscape; Project drivers; Transport infrastructure; Ecology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183588422"

It is the largest steel production facility in Australia with throughput of crude steel of over three million tonnes per annum. BlueScope own and operate five berths within Port Kembla. These assets underpin BlueScope as a critical part of the company's supply chain. To maintain the reliability, uptime, and function of the wharves, BlueScope and Beca have sought to solve one of the largest port and wharf challenges: how to turn aging port information, drawings, and schematics into a digital asset that can reduce rework, improve decision-making, and reduce costs. The project area spans more than 1.5km, including thousands of assets. BlueScope and Beca have been working together to create a spatially accurate three-dimensional digital twin of the Port. The Twin is designed to create new efficiencies for future projects and operations for BlueScope as it looks forward to the next century. The Twin can help the organisation unlock greater berth flexibility, reduce tendering costs, minimise risk, minimise shutdowns, and drive productivity enhancements in design, construction, operations, and maintenance activities. This paper outlines the project's motivations and requirements, as well as the strategies employed by the project team to overcome challenges associated with utilizing historical archive drawings and spatial data. By developing a reliable digital twin for BlueScope's port assets in Port Kembla, this paper also shares valuable insights that owners of similar assets can adopt to more quickly reap the benefits. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BlueScope Port Kembla; building information modelling (BIM); digital twins; extension of life; port structures","Architectural design; Cost reduction; Decision making; Digital storage; Plant shutdowns; Steelmaking; Supply chains; Throughput; Australia; Blue-scope steels; Bluescope port kembla; Building information modeling; Building Information Modelling; Digital asset management; Extension of life; Port infrastructure; Production facility; Steel production; Port structures","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183583109"

Today, these images can come from a wide variety of devices, from dedicated industrial scanners through semiprofessional sports cameras to smartphones equipped with the proper software. They also constitute a crucial input for smart indoor systems, such as automatic vacuum cleaners or surveillance cameras, and are essential for the construction of a building's digital twin. One of the most popular data representations used for spherical pictures is an equirectangular panorama (ERP). Although popular, processing it is demanding - ERP is heavily distorted, typically of high resolution, and made with discontinued lighting conditions. Transferring it to the cloud is challenging and the in-place analysis on the edge device is complicated. Nevertheless, ERPs store massive amounts of data, especially in the context of the number of objects captured in a single image. Many techniques dedicated to aberration-resilient object detection were presented. However, they all required proper preprocessing of the data or changed the detection approach so much that it made them unfit for any other task. In this paper, we present research on the processing of an indoor equirectangular panorama (I-ERP) using a family of object detectors called YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once, fifth generation). We discuss the process of adjusting an already available dataset to a newer annotation representation and test the usefulness of these detectors on such input without any changes to the detector models themselves. The results achieved indicate that the newer generation of YOLO detectors can be used with satisfactory results on the panoramic input and that the performance gap in I-ERP processing between dedicated and out-of-the-shelf solutions is closing. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","equirectangular panorama; object detection; smart indoor systems; YOLOv5","Cameras; Object recognition; Security systems; Statistical tests; Vacuum cleaners; Digitisation; Equirectangular panoramas; Indoor environment; Indoor systems; Objects detection; Smart indoor system; Smart phones; Spherical images; Virtual tour; YOLOv5; Object detection","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183539400"

However, high traffic burdens on mobile and fixed network infrastructures exist. This is because the digital twin requires collecting large amounts of local sensing data from local nodes such as sensors and personal devices. Wireless multi-hop networks can offload mobile traffic via wireless direct communications. However, fundamental issues in path construction and maintenance efficiency exist, owing to fast topological changes caused by node mobility and radio interference. Previous studies have comprehensively addressed such issues using initial path injection via digital twin, the characteristics of opportunistic routing based on the adaptive path selection, and convergence via continual packet transmissions. However, packet transmission failures occur when the injected initial and ideal forwarding paths differ because there is no redundancy in the initial forwarding path lacks redundancy. In this study, we propose a digital twin-enabled opportunistic routing that injects initial cost information into nodes along and around a path to provide path redundancy. Finally, we analyzed the impact of initial path injection by varying the redundancy level in the proposed method, compared to the non-redundant initial path used in the previous method. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ad hoc network; backoff; destination discovery; digital twin; location information; opportunistic routing","Digital devices; Mobile ad hoc networks; Radio interference; Smart city; Ad-hoc networks; Backoffs; Based on detections; City scale; Destination discovery; Location information; Opportunistic routing; Packet transmissions; Redundant paths; Service-based; Redundancy","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182947407"

This article proposes an innovative approach for change detection in 3D point clouds using deep learned place recognition descriptors and irregular object extraction based on voxel-to-point comparison. The proposed method first aligns the bi-temporal point clouds using a map-merging algorithm in order to establish a common coordinate frame. Then, it utilizes deep learning techniques to extract robust and discriminative features from the 3D point cloud scans, which are used to detect changes between consecutive point cloud frames and therefore find the changed areas. Finally, the altered areas are sampled and compared between the two time instances to extract any obstructions that caused the area to change. The proposed method was successfully evaluated in real-world field experiments, where it was able to detect different types of changes in 3D point clouds, such as object or muck-pile addition and displacement, showcasing the effectiveness of the approach. The results of this study demonstrate important implications for various applications, including safety and security monitoring in construction sites, mapping and exploration and suggests potential future research directions in this field. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Change detection; Extraction; Object detection; Piles; 3D point cloud; Autonomous navigation; Descriptors; Industrial environments; Innovative approaches; Irregular objects; Object extraction; Place recognition; Point-clouds; Deep learning","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182524039"

However, digitalization has not yet brought its greatest benefit for tackling the rising global energy demand and is even generally associated with more energy consumption. Instead, it has become urgent to rationalize energy use and decrease energy wastes. Indeed, buildings are responsible for about one third of the global energy consumption in the world [1], and 30% of this energy is even wasted through wrong or suboptimal operation, malfunctions and energy-unaware user behavior. Technologies supporting resource saving already exist for e.g. fault detection and mitigation, optimized energy systems control or predictive maintenance. But they necessitate much manual effort by experts to be configured and deployed since every building is to some extent unique with regard to its location, equipment and usage. Moreover, they require much expert knowledge and are not adapted for a daily usage by facility managers or even building users. These measures require also many data for continuous observation, analysis and system adaptations in real time. Although modern building management systems (BMS) can generate lots of monitoring data from sensors and meters, there is still poor or no reuse of building design data already produced in preliminary stages of the building life cycles. In view of these facts, this paper proposes a new data management workflow that relies on the reuse of building design information for facility management, and that shall fasten the deployment of energy-saving services while increasing user energy awareness and engagement in reducing energy use. For that purpose, this workflow makes use of building information modeling (BIM), knowledge graphs, data analysis and web technologies in order to develop a BIM-based Digital Twin for energy saving in the building operation phase. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Building Information Modeling; Condition Monitoring; Digital Twin; Energy Monitoring; Expert System; Knowledge Graph","Architectural design; Behavioral research; Condition monitoring; Construction industry; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Fault detection; Information management; Information theory; Life cycle; Office buildings; Building design; Building Information Modelling; Energy; Energy monitoring; Energy systems; Energy use; Energy-consumption; Knowledge graphs; Model-based OPC; Reuse; Expert systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179511252"

Some actors are already realising that the power of DTs goes beyond efficiency gains and cost savings for internal processes, and recognise the potential of DT to enable the design of new service offerings. Uncovering the potential of DT in the development of new value propositions may lead firms to business model transformations, particularly to the expansion of servitization strategies. Thus, there is a need for more research exploring DT as a service enabler, and shedding light on the typologies and characteristics of these innovative digital services. To address the need for a more comprehensive understanding of DT-based services, we develop a taxonomy able to classify and characterise services enabled by DT. To develop this novel DT-based services taxonomy, we drew upon literature review and use cases. In our ongoing research, four main dimensions emerged to configure a taxonomy of digital twin-based services: service recipient, target operand resource, service content and service pricing model. The proposed taxonomy is intended to be useful in the understanding of the current DT-based service offerings and design principles. In addition, the taxonomy has potential to be used as a practical tool for service providers in the development of new DT-based services. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","DIGITAL ECONOMY; DIGITAL SERVICES; DIGITAL TWINS; SERVICE INNOVATION; TAXONOMY","Economics; Digital economy; Digital services; Efficiency gain; Energy; Extended abstracts; Manufacturing construction; Oil and gas; Power; Service innovation; Service offering; Taxonomies","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178640067"

In particular, Augmented Reality is effectively utilized in various applications, such as worker training and monitoring of multiple devices, by combining the physical components of the manufacturing site and digital elements into an intuitive and unified interface. However, the cost of constructing and maintaining the content of virtual reality is high, preventing its practical introduction in small and medium-sized enterprises. This is because each applications is accompanied by re-programming and re-design such as interface codes and instruction items. This paper proposes an approach to construct and manage a digital twin for augmented reality using neutral data representation which is Administration Asset Shell. This allows for less updates and small modifications when new application is added with relative low cost than legacy method.The comparison conducted with two applications for three different machine tools. Using the proposed method, we were able to confirm the reduction of programming work at the initial construction and the application of environmental changes without reprogramming.

In the use phase, the sustainability performance needs to be balanced with safety, health and comfort requirements, ensuring that the indoor activities can be carried out in a high-performing environment. Indoor air quality is one of the main proxies for health and safety in indoor spaces and maintaining appropriate quality levels is directly impacted by built asset condition, systems operation and other contextual factors as occupancy and weather. The Digital Building Logbook is a platform enabling the interconnection of the variety of datasets used for building management. This paper introduces a framework for implementing the Digital Building Logbook utilising semantic web technologies, in the perspective of supporting better data access and knowledge extraction for Digital Twin applications in the Facilities Management domain. The proposed framework is based on the combination of Industry Foundation Classes, the BrickSchema and a custom Digital Building Logbook ontology, needed to extend the previous two. The Digital Building Logbook ontology is based on OWL and allows to structure the information on assets, maintenance interventions associated to the different spaces and systems, while IFC and BrickSchema provide a support in representing a selection of spatial and semantic building features. The developed framework aims at enhancing the data access and knowledge extraction on the building and facilitates the digital Facilities Management applications development. A validation is carried out on the Alan Reece building at the University of Cambridge and demonstrates its effectiveness in developing users' health-based maintenance prioritisation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Data mining; Extraction; Indoor air pollution; Intelligent buildings; Ontology; Sustainable development; Building management; Data access; Facilities management; Impact on the environment; Indoor activities; Knowledge extraction; Ontology's; Sustainability objectives; Sustainability performance; Use Phase; Air quality","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178555703"

This provides an unprecedented opportunity to feed large amount of sensing data collected from the physical factory into the construction of digital twin (DT) in cyberspace. However, little has been done to fully utilize the DT technology to improve the smartness and autonomous levels of small and medium-sized manufacturing factories. Indeed, only a small fraction of small and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs) has considered implementing DT technology. There is an urgent need to exploit the full potential of data analytics and simulation-enabled DTs for advanced manufacturing. Hence, this paper presents the design and development of DT models for simulation optimization of manufacturing process flows. First, we develop a multi-agent simulation model that describes nonlinear and stochastic dynamics among a network of interactive manufacturing things, including customers, machines, automated guided vehicles (AGVs), queues, and jobs. Second, we propose a statistical metamodeling approach to design sequential computer experiments to optimize the utilization of AGV under uncertainty. Third, we construct two new graph models - job flow graph and AGV traveling graph - to track and monitor the real-time performance of manufacturing jobshops. The proposed simulation-enabled DT approach is evaluated and validated with experimental studies for the representation of a real-world manufacturing factory. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology effectively transforms a manufacturing jobshop into a new generation of DT-enabled smart factories. The sequential design of experiments effectively reduces the computation overhead of expensive simulations while optimally scheduling the AGV to achieve production throughputs in a cost-effective way. This research is strongly promised to help SMMs fully utilize big data and DT technologies for gaining competitive advantages in the global market. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Design of experiments; digital twin; graph model; manufacturing systems; multi-agent simulation","Automatic guided vehicles; Competition; Cost effectiveness; Data Analytics; Flow graphs; International trade; Metadata; Multi agent systems; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Automated guided vehicles; Graph model; Job-shop; Large amounts; Manufacturing factories; Manufacturing process; Multi-agents simulations; Process flows; Sensing data; Simulation and optimization; Design of experiments","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176800865"

This study proposed a digital twin framework for the laser powder bed fusion AM process control and optimization. The framework is created based on the recently developed advanced point-wise scan control method.

In order to expand the application of digital twin technology in laser machining, taking the processing of 7075 aluminum alloy by nanosecond laser marking machine as an example, the important role of finite element simulation in laser machining was expounded. However, due to the large computational amount of finite element simulation and the limited computing level of current computers, the simulation calculation time was long, which could not meet the real-time mapping required by digital twin technology. Therefore, a method of replacing finite element simulation with CGAN (conditional generative adversarial network) model was proposed. In this method, the CGAN model was trained by using the working condition images after image processing and the temperature cloud maps obtained by finite element simulation. Then, the trained CGAN model was packaged for building the surface temperature monitoring system for laser machining parts based on the digital twin. After completing the construction of the virtual end of the digital twin temperature monitoring system, the MQTT (message queuing telemetry transport) communication protocol was used to interact with the physical end to realize the remote monitoring and operation of the digital twin system. The surface temperature monitoring system for laser machining parts based on digital twin achieves the rapid simulation calculation of the surface temperature of parts, which solves the problems of long calculation time and inability to achieve real-time mapping by the finite element simulation. It can basically meet the monitoring and prediction of the surface temperature of laser machining parts, and has certain reference value in the field of laser machining temperature monitoring. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN); digital twin; finite element simulation; image processing; laser machining","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176745936"

This study looks at in-depth cases of large university campus owners and the challenges that this IOT introduces for the maintenance and management of these systems and the data they collect. In this ethnography there are three main time orientations related to facilities management (Facilities), Information Technology (IT), and Capital Projects. First, a university campus is like a small city, with buildings, utilities, and transportation systems - taken together we call this campus infrastructure (buildings 50-100, roads and utilities 20-50 years). Second, IT employees think on 2–3-month scale, working through implementing software and hardware upgrades, configurations and patches, at times needing agile operations to deal with emerging cybersecurity threats. Third, in Capital Projects the design phase can last 9 months, and the construction from 1 - 2 years for a typical project, and this is where IOT technologies are often first introduced into campus. While the capital project teams reflect on the user experience, these teams are often removed from the realities of facilities management and do not understand the time scales or the scope of the work that is required to manage a portfolio of Facilities and IT systems. In this paper, we explore how these time orientations lead to tensions in the owners’ selection of IOT devices and systems, in the integration of new technologies into existing systems, and in the operations of keeping existing systems up and running for the longer time scales of campus infrastructure life spans. Furthermore, this paper presents a paradox: If they speed up, they lose things, if they slow down, they lose other things, and presents ways that owner organizations manage this paradox through temporal boundary spanners who understand the disciplinary requirements, cultures, and frameworks across the organization and helps to mitigate the tensions across these differences. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Facilities Management; Information Technology; Internet of Things; Operations; Organizational Issues; Time Orientations","Human resource management; Information management; Capital projects; Construction time; Existing systems; Facilities management; Information construction; Operation; Organizational issues; Time orientation; Time-scales; University campus; Internet of things","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176443354"

In the last decade, the number of mechatronic components (sensors, actuators, etc.) in a system is increasing enormously to enable more flexible, intelligent production with more support for customization. Mechatronic variability, like different variants of sensors or actuators in the system, directly affects the control software. The standardization of physical interfaces of mechatronic components has provided well-defined plug-and-play interaction. Conversely, software components in the CPPS domain still face the issue of standardizing functionality. Software adaptability often leads engineers to develop control software for new mechatronic variants by just copying and modifying existing software. This leads to multiple and completely separate instances of the control software and a high development and maintenance effort. The core functionality of the control software should be standardized and reused as much as possible to reduce the development effort and improve overall reliability. This paper discusses an approach to standardize core functionality of IEC 61499-based control software. Our design approach encapsulates the process core functionality and defines standard interfaces for interacting with mechatronic variant software components. We evaluate our design approach by comparing it to the traditional clone-and-own approach for an academic case study system, a capping station. Additionally, we assess the impact of adding a new variant in the control software and analyze what changes are needed to keep the same core functionality. When introducing new mechatronic variants in combination with standardized core functionality, our design approach reduces the overall control software variance and maintenance effort. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Control-Software; Cyber-Physical Production System; IEC 61499; Modularization; Software Product Line","Actuators; Cyber Physical System; Modular construction; Product design; Software reliability; Control software; Core functionality; Cybe-physical production system; Cyber physicals; Design approaches; IEC 61499; Modularizations; Production system; Software Product Line; Software-component; Software design","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175460435"

This paper presents a new vision-based construction monitoring approach that reduces the geometric information provided in exchange for a higher time resolution and a higher level of automation. Instead of the detailed geometry, the real-time status of the building elements is provided. It is applied to cast-in-place concrete columns, identifying individual operational steps. The approach is based on projecting building elements from a building model onto images of a fixed on-site camera to then classify them according to the current element status with the help of a CNN. Using image sequences additionally allows accounting for moving objects and other outliers, which makes the approach robust and reliable. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Automated approach; Building element; Cast in place; Construction phase; Construction process; Fully automated; Near-real time; Process-oriented; Productivity analysis; Shell construction; Project management","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174444752"

The researchers selected the significant postures, and the real scenario was replicated in a virtual environment and performed a simulation to evaluate the ergonomic risks involved in the tasks. The findings indicated that the workers were at high risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders in the trunk, neck, wrist, and arm during formwork operations which could result in long-lasting harm to the workers. The recommendations were provided based on the study findings, including changes in methods to avoid and reduce the signs of musculoskeletal disorder risk caused by the original operations.

The crux of these digital technologies lies in capturing the rich “real physical” data to model the “virtual” structure to enable the experiments for specific decision-making. Although protocols for the hazardous operations had been chalked out meticulously across the globe through several organizations using stern safety regulations and codal provisions, still the goal of zero-accidents at the construction site has not been achieved. One of the several reasons for accidents occurrence can be that safety is not always in the minds of the workers and require a third-party intervention. Hence, the objective of this study is to safeguard the workers working in the construction sites using digital platforms (third-party) where the safety is monitored round the clock. The scope of this study is limited to falling of materials, equipments and workers. To achieve this objective, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification System) is used to capture the site data and is modelled in BIM (Building Information Modeling) using Dynamo.

This change brings numerous benefits, such as cost and time efficiency and higher accuracy and quality. At the same time, it raises cybersecurity concerns. Since most construction environments are far from being human-free in the near future, the importance of providing robust cybersecurity when utilizing cyber-physical systems such as robots is augmented. The use of robotics in construction processes has long been under academia’s and industry’s spotlight, but the cybersecurity aspects have not received the attention they deserve. Several surveys have shown low awareness among construction stakeholders about cybersecurity, which increases the need for further studies on this topic. This study provides an overview of the first academic-driven cybersecurity competition in the construction context, Hack My Robot (HMR), as part of CSAW’22, the most comprehensive student-run cybersecurity event in the world. HMR was held for the first time at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD). The competition had two main rounds: the qualification round and the final round, where students presented their ideas to compromise the provided robotic system’s functionality and the collected information. The system used in the competition imitated a construction progress monitoring robot that utilizes Robotic Operating System (ROS).

To address this challenge, a dual-layered digital twin paradigm is proposed in this paper to enable intelligent network orchestration for fast real-time optimization of 6G networks. Rapid identification of problematic network situations and the corresponding fast decision-making in tackling the related issues are successively achieved by the two layers of the proposed digital twin.

Consequently, poor levels of space management, use, and cleanness are detected during the O&M phase, affecting user well-being and satisfaction. Occupancy monitoring and analysis are needed to achieve effective and efficient facility management (FM) and user well-being.

The performed analysis uncovered the temporal distribution of the publications and the relationships among the topics. DT is a recent topic in the early stages of investigation, while POEs are mature approaches related to sustainability, energy efficiency, productivity, building performance optimization, and user satisfaction. Occupancy detection and analysis are related to FM but less investigated topics in recent years.

The introduction of building lifecycle management (BLM) could lead to several benefits covering all the phases of the building lifecycle (BLC) and enabling the implementation of a model-based integrated management system. Nevertheless, its adoption is far from being spread across the construction field and the case studies in the existing literature present several criticalities related to the adopted technologies and policies which hinder the complete development of a BLM system. To overcome these obstacles, digital twins (DTs) could be exploited to enhance the collaboration among actors, preserving the integrity of data, and offering a multidisciplinary environment to carry out realistic simulations. The purpose of this research is to conduct a scientometric analysis to evaluate the relationships between the topics of BLM and DT in the AECO-FM sector. The most common key studies and patterns are identified by processing bibliometric metadata. The most investigated topics related to BLM and DT are system design, system management, and Building Information Modeling (BIM) applications.

These exceptional structures generally fall outside the existing regulations and classic frameworks for monitoring and maintenance, whatever the country. In that sense, they require, from the moment they are commissioned, a particular expertise and approach for their continuous monitoring, calling in particular for the production of risk analysis matrices, sensitivity analyses (wind, earthquake, assembly fatigue, etc.), exhaustive maintenance manuals adapted to each structure, regular campaigns of targeted non-destructive tests, while having recourse to particular means of access associated with different types of inspection carried out by qualified and experienced inspectors. In order to ensure that these structures behave well over time, they are generally monitored, which requires individualized use of the data acquired by the SHMS, whose program can be adapted a posteriori after a period of learning about the actual functioning of the structure. To complete this monitoring, it is necessary to implement a specific follow-up of the durability of materials and more specifically of reinforced concrete, to carry out updated digital twins associated with adapted management software. All this specific approach is necessary to have a clear and exhaustive vision of the condition of these structures and the follow-up of their good ageing over time, which sometimes differs significantly from what is foreseen at the time of the design; the objective being in particular to ensure the safety of the operation and the users and to engage the maintenance works at the right time and at the least cost, for a durability which must exceed 120 years for these exceptional and unique structures. Through emblematic examples, we propose to present these specific approaches implemented on large structures, whether pathological or not, and the proposed management strategies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital twin; Inspection; Monitoring; organized monitoring; predictive maintenance; preventive","Bridges; Durability; Life cycle; Nondestructive examination; Preventive maintenance; Reinforced concrete; Risk assessment; Sensitivity analysis; Construction technique; Continuous monitoring; Design adaptations; Follow up; Life Cycle Maintenance; Long-span bridge; Organized monitoring; Predictive maintenance; Preventive; Variable geometry; Risk analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171449933"

In the late 15th century Leonardo da Vinci researched the behaviour of bending of elastic beams of various spans using physical models. Later, in the 20th century, physical models were indispensable for civil engineers and architects to check the load-bearing capacity of unconventional and innovative structures. Even today, physical models are used in different engineering disciplines, for example, to test the behaviour of long-span bridges in wind tunnels. This paper attempts to give an overview of important testing facilities which achieved technological progress in the field of bridge engineering. The models built and the tests performed in these facilities will be used as examples and will answer the question of the critical role these models played in the planning and construction process.

However, BAS was historically developed as a closed environment and designed with limited cyber-security considerations. Thus, smart buildings are vulnerable to cyber-attacks with the increased accessibility. This study introduces the development and capability of a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testbed for testing and evaluating the cyber-physical security of typical BASs in smart buildings. The testbed consists of three subsystems: (1) a real-time HIL emulator simulating the behavior of a virtual building as well as the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) equipment via a dynamic simulation in Modelica; (2) a set of real HVAC controllers monitoring the virtual building operation and providing local control signals to control HVAC equipment in the HIL emulator; and (3) a BAS server along with a web-based service for users to fully access the schedule, setpoints, trends, alarms, and other control functions of the HVAC controllers remotely through the BACnet network. The server generates rule-based setpoints to local HVAC controllers. Based on these three subsystems, the HIL testbed supports attack/fault-free and attack/fault-injection experiments at various levels of the building system. The resulting test data can be used to inform the building community and support the cyber-physical security technology transfer to the building industry. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Automation; Computer hardware; Construction industry; Cyber Physical System; Cybersecurity; Hardware-in-the-loop simulation; HVAC; Intelligent buildings; Internet of things; Interoperability; Network security; Synthetic apertures; Technology transfer; Testbeds; Air-conditioning controllers; Building automation systems; Communicationtechnology; Conditioning equipment; Cyber-Physical securities; Hardware in the loops; Heating ventilation and air conditioning; Open communication; Setpoints; Virtual building; Controllers","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171186867"

Hence, it is necessary to use an acceptable computational effort to predict the HPT blade's load and in-service lifetime. Drawing from the idea of the usage-based life (UBL) prediction method, this paper first proposes a framework for the life digital twin (LDT) to characterize and track the in-service life consumption of the HPT blades under actual operating conditions. The second work mainly focuses on developing the steady-state and transient load calculation surrogate models for the HPT blade's LDT. Using the developed surrogate models, it can now calculate the steady-state and transient loads of the HPT blade in an acceptable time with the necessary accuracy. The proposed approach is demonstrated on an HPT blade of a typical commercial turbofan engine. Because the operating load of the HPT blade severely affects its in-service lifetime, the application of this approach enables the construction of an LDT of the HPT blade. It can reduce the uncertainty and variability associated with the in-service life prediction of the HPT blade under actual operating conditions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","high-pressure turbine blade; in-service lifetime; life digital twin; load surrogate model","Service life; Turbine components; Turbofan engines; Turbomachine blades; Blade life; Blade loads; High pressure turbine blade; In-service lifetime; Life digital twin; Load calculation; Load surrogate model; Operating condition; Service lifetime; Surrogate modeling; Forecasting","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170081442"

In this paper, we give an overview of literature related to flexibility and add transparency to the relationship between engineering changes, product development, and production. Based on that, we propose a conceptual framework for co-development to improve the flexibility of product development and production. As part of the framework, we introduce a visualization that reveals the propagation of changes in the product and into the production to create deeper insights for conjoint redesign. To exploit further synergies of product and production, we suggest modularization with focus on strategic module drivers enhancing flexibility.

In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great potential in automatic crack detection and segmentation. However, most of the current CNNs tend to lose high-resolution details and, therefore, lead to blurry object boundaries; this results in poor performance for crack images with complex backgrounds in engineering structures. This study proposes a two-stream boundary-aware crack segmentation (BACS) network that combines semantic image segmentation with semantically informed edge detection explicitly. Firstly, a high-resolution network (HRNet) is utilized in the segmentation branch for strong high-resolution representations through repeatedly conducting multi-scale fusions across parallel convolutions. Furthermore, an edge branch is utilized for preserving fine-grained details of elongated thin cracks, which adopts a modified dynamic feature fusion (DFF) network to produce more accurate and sharper edge predictions. The proposed method is evaluated using a dataset of 1,892 images for three different scenarios. The results show that the mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) scores reach 79.26%, 68.74%, and 70.31% for pure crack, complex background, and variable-width scenarios, respectively. In addition, crack width quantification is performed to validate the accuracy in terms of engineering practice. The BACS achieves high accuracy with an average absolute error of 0.0992 mm, which corresponds to approximately two pixels in the images.

Since our drilling wells are becoming much more challenging than ever before, it requires the office engineer not only understanding well construction knowledge but also need learn more about geology to help them address the unexpected scenarios may happen to the wells. Then a novel solution should be provided to help engineers understanding their wells better and easier in engineering and geology aspects. The digital twin technology is used to generate a suppositional subsurface world which contains downhole schematic and nearby formation characteristics. This world is described in 3D modelling engineers could read all the information they need after dealt with a unique algorithm engine. In this digital twin subsurface world, the engineering information like well trajectory, casing program, BHA (bottom hole assembly) status, are combined with geology data like formation lithology, layer distribution and coring samples. Both drilling or completion engineers and geologist could get an intuitive awareness of current downhole scenarios and discuss in a more efficient way. The system has been deployed in a major operator in China this year and received lot of valuable feedback from end user. First of all, the system brings solid benefits to operator's supervisors and engineers to help them relate the engineering challenges with according geology information, in this way the judgement and decision are made more reliable and efficiently, also the solution or proposal could be provided more targeted and available. Beyond, the geology information from nearby wells in digital twin modelling could also provide an intuitional navigation or guidance to under-constructed wells avoid any possible tough layers via adjusting drilling parameters. This digital twin system breaks the barrier between well construction engineers and geologists, revealing a fictive downhole world which is based on the knowledge and insight of our industry, providing the engineers necessary information to support their judgement and assumption at very first time when they meet downhole problems. For example, drilling engineers would pay extra attention to control the ROP (rate of penetration) while drilling ahead to fault layer at the first time it is displayed in digital twin system, which prevent potential downhole accident and avoid related NPT (non-production time). The integration of engineering and geology is a must-do task for operators and service companies to improve their performance and reduce downhole risks. Also, it provides an interdisciplinary information to end user for their better awareness and understanding of their downhole asset. Not only help to avoid some possible downhole risks but also benefit on preventing damage reservoir by optimizing the well construction parameters. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","3D modeling; Gasoline; Infill drilling; Integration; Lithology; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3D models; 3d-modeling; Construction knowledge; Downholes; End-users; Formation characteristics; Learn+; Novel solutions; Service companies; Well constructions; Engineers","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161280009"

However, the current workshop digital twin model lacks a framework that can correlate the entire physical entity of the workshop and continuously compute and learn to empower the workshop with cognitive capabilities that can adapt to changing production conditions or new production scenarios. In this paper, a workshop digital twin model construction method based on group systems cognition (GS C) is proposed, aiming to realize the overall cognition of workshop production process in multiple layers from low-level physical subsystem to high-level group systems. Combining digital twin technology with the general cognitive principles of human problem solving in cognitive science, a workshop digital twin model framework including physical layer, virtual layer and cognitive layer is established; then, a multi-level cognitive computing model with sustainable learning capability was constructed by using information technology, so that the workshop twin model has cognitive capability. Finally, the application validation of the GSC-based workshop twin was carried out in an aerospace structural component manufacturing workshop as an example, and it was verified that GSC can endow the workshop twin with certain cognitive ability and effectively improve the workshop productivity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cognition; group systems; Workshop twin model","Engineering education; Virtual reality; 'current; Cognition; Cognitive capability; Continuous optimization; Group systems; Key technologies; Learn+; Model-based OPC; Production process; Workshop twin model; Optimization","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159642298"

It is hypothesized that BIMs will transform from a static 3D model to a Digital Twin providing a truly digital representation of the physical asset or the building it represents. This transformation to a dynamic Digital Twin will allow the A/E/C/FM industry to visualize, monitor, and optimize operational assets and processes to support better inspection and analysis for a more efficient facility operations and maintenance. To support the adoption and implementation of Digital Twin in A/E/C/FM, the authors have defined two clear objectives. First, we discuss requirements for a functionality-based canonical architecture to create a digital twin followed by proposing two tool-based system architecture options for its implementation. Second, we use a case study approach to develop a proof-of-concept Digital Twin of an operating room in a healthcare facility using Power BI Desktop and Azure Services. The prototype aims to monitor room air quality as per INAIL (National Institute for Insurance against Accidents at Work) and ISO (International Organization for Standards) standards. Multiple sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi 4 are used to capture real-time data for various air quality parameters including temperature, humidity, airflow, particulate contamination, and Nitrous Oxide (N2O) gas. Multiple dashboards are also created to visualize, monitor, and analyze the data harnessed from the OR sensors. The implementation addresses critical issues including security, data storage, visualization, processing, data streaming, collection, and analysis. As an initial validation, the Digital Twin prototype was presented and discussed with a healthcare BIM manager. Initial feedback from the industry expert indicated that the prototype could decrease the required time to respond to facility maintenance issues such as decreased air flow due to possible obstructions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Azure Services; Facility Management; IoT Devices; Levels of Digital Twins; Power BI; Raspberry Pi 4; System Architecture","3D modeling; Architectural design; Computer architecture; Data visualization; Digital devices; Digital storage; Internet of things; Office buildings; Azure service; Building Information Modelling; Facilities management; Healthcare facility; IoT device; Level of digital twin; Power; Power BI; Raspberry pi 4; Systems architecture; Data handling","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158066035"

Automating driving tasks also automates the related decisions. However, humans are very good at dealing with bad quality, fuzzy, informal and incomplete information, whereas machines generally require solid quality information in a formalized format. Therefore, the development of automated driving functions relies on the availability of machine-usable information. A digital twin contains quality controlled information collected and augmented from different sources, ready to be supplied to such an automated driving function. An information model that describes all conceivably relevant information is necessary. To this end, a list of requirements that such an information model should meet is proposed and each requirement is argued for. Based on the anticipated services and applications that such a system should support, a collection of requirements for system architecture is derived. Information modeling is performed for selected relevant information groups.

Such applications provide multimodal, interactive, immersive, embodied, and sensory experiences unique and different from typical game art environments because they are geospatial visualizations of data and information derived from ecological field plot studies, geographical information systems, drone images, and botanically correct 3D plant models visualized in real-time interactive game engines. Since they are constructed from geometric objects, they can programmatically self-express semantic data and connect to knowledge stores on the Internet to create a web of knowledge for both exploration of a virtual environment as a natural landscape and for exploration of connected knowledge stores for informal learning at the moment of curiosity. This design is exceptionally powerful for informal learning as it supports the innate human desire to understand the world. This paper summarizes the construction methods used for creating three digital twins of natural environments and the informal learning applications created and distributed, namely, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and virtual field trips. Informal learning outcomes and emotional reactions are evaluated using mixed-methods research studies to understand the impact of design factors. Visual fidelity and navigational freedom are combined to increase learning outcomes and many effective and emotional outcomes as well. Access to facts and story increase learning outcomes, and applications evaluated as beautiful are correlated with emotional reactions of awe and wonder, and awe and wonder are correlated with higher learning gains. Beauty is correlated with other system-wide subjective evaluations largely accepted as important to create a context conducive to support learning outcomes, such as calmness, excitement, and curiosity, a desire to share, and a desire to create.

Many innovative and creative services such as virtual conference and tourism have been realized in the digital twins maintained by the virtual service providers (VSP) in Metaverse. Digital twins are digital copies of the physical world constructed virtually by the VSPs using real-world data. For a realistic experience, VSPs need to collect data that is up-to-date and relevant to their services. In this paper, we propose an incentive design framework to support the data trading between VSPs and edge devices. In the auction model, we model the valuation of data by considering data relatedness and data freshness.

This is why digital twins have become quite popular in recent years in both rail and road domain applications, and some researchers and engineers have started considering the term as a buzz word that attracts increased interest in their research. In some cases, this leads to misunderstandings regarding the digital twin concept, especially if the discussion relates to digital twins built on physics-based models. This paper’s detailed review has been performed to address this issue considering the application of vehicle system dynamics theories as a basis for development of digital twins and the implementation process in digital twin studies. The results show that most works are focusing on digital twin developments at the ‘top level of the pyramid’ and more comprehensive research and investigation studies are needed in terms of the application of vehicle system dynamics in design and construction of digital twins.

Unfortunately, diverse geological and hydrogeological conditions and complex shapes of the foundation pit create barriers for reliable FPE risk prognosis and control. Furthermore, typical support systems during FPE use temporary measures, which have limited capacity to confront excessive loads, large deformations, and seepage. This study aims to establish an intelligent risk prognosis and control framework based on digital twin (DT) for ensuring safe and effective FPE processes. Previous studies have conducted extensive experimental and numerical analyses for examining unsafe conditions during FPE. How to enable intelligent risk prognosis and control of tedious FPE processes by integrating physics-based models and sensory data collected in the field is still challenging. DT could help to establish the interaction and feedback mechanisms between the physical and virtual space. In this study, the authors have established a DT model that consists of a physical space model and a high-fidelity physics-based model of a foundation pit in virtual space. As a result, a mechanism for effective acquisition and fusion of heterogeneous information from both physical and virtual space is established. Then, the authors proposed an integrated model and data-driven approach for examining safety risks during FPE. In the end, the authors have validated the proposed method through a case study of the FPE of the Wuhan Metro Line. The results show that the proposed method could provide theoretical and practical support for future intelligent FPE. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","construction safety; digital twin; foundation pit excavation; risk prognosis and control","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146665070"

For this purpose, we acquire RGB images of the individual stones and of the wall during the construction phase. In our framework, we use structure from motion (SfM) to first generate 3D source and destination models, which are then registered to form the GDT through non-linear least squares and 2D point feature correspondences detected on the SfM images. This method contrasts with traditional techniques that register point clouds using 3D point descriptors. Because of the robustness of image feature descriptors, we found that using 2D instead of 3D point features facilitates the automation of the GDT generation. To benchmark our algorithm, we compared the results through an Euclidean–distance-based proposed metric with a known 3D textured model from which images were synthetically generated. We show the robustness and feasibility of our method for full size elements, wherein GDTs were generated for dry-stone and stone-mortar systems.

However, a suitable information system has yet to be established. Therefore, a combined digital twin and location based management system was developed. The digital twin concept relies on continuous, real time data collection to provide information about the project's status. The combination of both methods facilitates effective, data-based production planning of the resources’ flow over time and space. The proposed system offers the ability to proactively manage real-time information for ongoing location-based work through discrete event simulation. For improved understanding among stakeholders, the simulated processes are visualised in a 4D game engine. In an exploratory study, the system's effectiveness was demonstrated by using literature-based changes in productivity rates during the construction of finishing work in a high-rise building.

However, DT development in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry is still in its infancy. Digital twins have been proposed as tools that can be applied to several challenges in various areas of the built environment. However, their widespread use is hampered due to the slow pace of digitization of the AEC industry, in addition to the absence of a formalized standard for digital twins’ implementation. We began this study by systematically reviewing publications related to DT applications in the AEC industry in four databases, resulting in 229 publications after applying the proposed criteria. The systematic review highlighted the lack of standardization for DTs in the AEC industry. Additionally, this study assessed the current status of DTs and analyzed the evolution of the concept of DTs in the AEC industry.

Various operations on blockchain are performed through the invocation and execution of smart contracts. This leads to extensive combinations between blockchain, smart contract, Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical System (CPS) applications, and then many blockchain-based IoT or CPS applications emerge to provide multiple benefits to the economy and society. In this case, obtaining a better understanding of smart contracts will contribute to the easier operation, higher efficiency and stronger security of those blockchain-based systems and applications. Many existing studies on smart contract analysis are based on similarity calculation and smart contract classification. However, smart contract is a piece of code with special characteristics and most of smart contracts are stored without any category labels, which leads to difficulties of smart contract classification. As the back end of a blockchain-based Decentralized Application (DApp) is one or several smart contracts, DApps with labeled categories and open source codes are applied to achieve a supervised smart contract classification. A three-phase approach is proposed to categorize DApps based on various data features. In this approach, 5,659 DApps with smart contract source codes and pre-tagged categories are first obtained based on massive collected DApps and smart contracts from Ethereum, State of the DApps and DappRadar. Then feature extraction and construction methods are designed to form multi-feature vectors that could present the major characteristics of DApps. Finally, a fused classification model consisting of KNN, XGBoost and random forests is applied to the multi-feature vectors of all DApps for performing DApp classification. The experimental results show that the method is effective. In addition, some positive correlations between feature variables and categories, as well as several user behavior patterns of DApp calls, are found in this paper. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Blockchain-based application; DApp classification; Smart contract; Solidity","Behavioral research; Blockchain; Codes (symbols); Embedded systems; Internet of things; Application classifications; Block-chain; Blockchain-based application; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Decentralised; Decentralized application classification; Solidity; System applications; Smart contract","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142859048"

However, the current Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data schema for Building Information Modelling (BIM) provided limited support to represent full semantics related to environmental sensing and monitoring. How to semantically enrich the IFC schema with enhanced data description capability for informed decision-making in smart facilities management (FM) amid COVID situations remains an open question. This paper develops a semi-automatic extension and integration of IFC data schema with Sensor Model Language (SensorML) specification in order to support automated built environment sensing and monitoring. Referring to SensorML, an extended IFC model view definition for a comprehensive description of required sensor metadata and sensing entities is presented. An Internet of Things (IoT) sensor network is then established to realise continuous data collection from a variety of wireless sensing devices. The spatial-temporal data captured by the IoT sensor network are extracted by a regular expression-based data distillation algorithm and integrated with the digital twin, in which spatial interpolation algorithms further analyse, compute, and visualise the state of the environment. The proposed method is demonstrated via an experimental study which supports real-time environmental monitoring and delivers more actionable insights to facility managers to sustain the daily operation of buildings. This study contributes new methods and models to semantically enrich the digital twin from the data perspective for environmental condition monitoring during the pandemic time which fosters the development of holistic building facility management. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Building information modelling; Condition monitoring; Digital twins; Facilities management; Industry foundation classes; Internet of things","Architectural design; Condition monitoring; Decision making; Distillation; Environmental management; Information theory; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Semantics; Wireless sensor networks; Building Information Modelling; Built environment; Environment monitoring; Environment sensing; Environmental conditions; Environmental Monitoring; Facilities management; Industry foundation class; Model languages; Sensors models; Internet of things","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140141936"

It first gives a general introduction to the digital twin technology and operating rules, and then introduces the analytic hierarchy process and the complexity evolution process model for specific analysis. It first determines the relative weight vector, and then verifies the consistency of the judgment matrix to obtain the simulated probability density function. For the calculation of underground space safety accident risk assessment, the Bayesian network is used for evaluation. This facilitates disaster warnings of possible and ongoing accidents and reduces the adverse consequences of accidents. Then, the digital twin technology is applied to the analysis of underground space visualization, underground construction and underground disaster prevention monitoring. During the construction stage, the bottom of the upper structure column has changed a lot. The difference between the difference between the foundation difference between the adjacent color spectrum column of the upper structure is relatively mild. When digging a large area of ​​ground soil, the foundation dropped to 5.6 mm. When the soil on the side of the pile was removed, the ground building was basically settle down, 0.8 mm.

Subsequent sidewalk soil has almost no effect on the upper structure. At this stage, the final deposition difference is 2.427 mm, which meets the requirements of the neighboring column base in the current regulations.

Moreover, we aim at achieving safe exploration, meaning that the trajectory of the system is guaranteed to be in a safe region for all times while collecting the training data.

DT will demand the deployment of many sensors, and low-cost solutions are the only way to achieve that. In this study, low-cost Arduino-compatible sensors were tested considering the indoor environment of Southern European countries. Five different sensors of the following parameters were tested: temperature (T), relative humidity (RH) and carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>). The T and RH tests comprise a combination of short-term and long-term exposures over 24 months, ranging between 10 °C and 35 °C, and 50%–95%, respectively. In short-term exposure, CO<inf>2</inf> sensors were tested in six different CO<inf>2</inf> concentrations from 400 to 2500 ppm. For each CO<inf>2</inf> concentration, the values were compared, varying the T (15 °C to 25 °C) and the RH (50%–90%). The results highlighted that some low-cost sensors, open-source and easily connectable to Arduino, showed an excellent behaviour and general compliance with applicable standards. SHT85 T/RH sensor, stood out in the sample, and K30 and T6713-5K CO<inf>2</inf> sensors showed good accordance with the reference. The equivalent CO<inf>2</inf> sensors, that use algorithms to assess the CO<inf>2</inf> value, showed results far from the reference equipment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arduino; Digital twins; Indoor environmental quality (IEQ); Low-cost; Sensors","Costs; Energy efficiency; Regulatory compliance; AEC industry; Arduino; Built environment; CO 2 concentration; CO 2 sensor; Control and management; Indoor environmental quality; Low-costs; Temperature-relative humidity; Carbon dioxide","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138031699"

On the one hand, the Internet of Things (IoT) based on ICPSs construction needs a large amount of reasonable network resources support. On the other hand, ICPSs are facing severe network security problems. The integration of ICPSs and network virtualization (NV) can provide more efficient network resource support and security guarantees for IoT users. Based on the above two problems faced by ICPSs, we propose a virtual network embedded (VNE) algorithm with computing, storage resources, and security constraints to ensure the rationality and security of resource allocation in ICPSs. In particular, we use the reinforcement learning (RL) method as a means to improve algorithm performance. We extract the important attribute characteristics of the underlying network as the training environment of the RL agent. The agent can derive the optimal node embedding strategy through training, so as to meet the requirements of ICPSs for resource management and security. The embedding of virtual links is based on the breadth first search (BFS) strategy. Therefore, this is a comprehensive two-stage RL-VNE algorithm considering the constraints of computing, storage, and security 3-D resources. Finally, we design a large number of simulation experiments from the perspective of typical indicators of VNE algorithms. The experimental results effectively illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in the application of ICPSs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Intelligent cyber-physical systems (ICPSs); Internet of Things (IoT); reinforcement learning (RL); resource allocation; security problems; virtual network embedding (VNE)","Cyber Physical System; Cybersecurity; Embedded systems; Facings; Heuristic algorithms; Internet of things; Natural resources management; Network embeddings; Network security; Reinforcement learning; Resource allocation; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Heuristics algorithm; Intelligent cybe-physical system; Reinforcement learning.; Reinforcement learnings; Resource management; Resources allocation; Security; Security problems; Virtual network embedding; Computer architecture","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103298564"

Digital twins, based on computational modeling, have enabled the creation of a digital map for physical structures. Research on digital twins (DTs) for constructed facilities projects has gained widespread traction in the industry. While these applications have increased over the years, there has been sparse review of them. This paper systematically reviews the applications of digital twins in construction using content analysis. We identified and analyzed 53 academic journal and conference papers, which revealed several DT applications that could be categorized into nine areas: lifecycle analysis, facility management, energy, education, disaster, structural health monitoring, DT for cities, infrastructure management, and miscellaneous. This enables the visualization of the current state of DT, comparison with the desired state, and possible integrations with other technologies. Among the observed benefits of DTs are the ability to increase engagement and collaboration, reduce construction and operating costs, reduce human error, automate energy demand, manage assets throughout their lifecycle, and apply structural health monitoring. It also enables the collection of real-time data on an asset’s status, history, maintenance needs, and provides an interactive platform for managing an asset. Future directions include addressing how to standardize data acquisition as well as the semantic interoperability and heterogeneity of data. Additionally, modeling human cognitive processes as well as spatiotemporal information would be beneficial to a smart city and other infrastructure systems, especially in disaster situations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital twins; infrastructure; literature review","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149468799"

However, there is no comprehensive review to our knowledge, holistically examining the benefits of using DT as a platform from the angles of Industry 4.0 technologies, project management, and building lifecycle. To bridge this gap, a systematic literature review of 182 papers on DT-in-construction works over the past 6 years is conducted to address the three perspectives. In this review, a unified framework is first modelled to incorporate Industry 4.0 technologies within the DT structure. Next, a Six M methodology (comprising of Machine, Manpower, Material, Measurement, Milieu, and Method) based on Ishikawa’s Diagram with building lifecycle considerations is proposed to highlight the advantages of DT in ensuring successful construction projects.

Every step requires a systematic approach in which the contribution of the diverse experts that participate in the conservation of heritage assets is analysed following the logical sequence of the project execution phase. However, there are still no scientific contributions that record the complete process. A logical sequence, called a ‘systematic approach’ in this paper, should start with data acquisition using remote sensing techniques, the insertion of point cloud data in a Building Information Modelling (BIM) environment, ontologies applied to HBIM (Historic BIM), data classification, and evolution towards the Digital Twin (DT) concept. This paper also analyses the modelling workflow of a case study, the construction of a column base of the Santiago church in Jerez de la Frontera (Spain). This component has been automatically modelled from a mesh in an Autodesk Revit family and through an adaptive mesh process in ArchiCAD. Furthermore, one of the objectives was the data organisation by following and extending a standard data structure of the column components.

The shown research is focused on robotically-manufactured, structurally-optimised reinforcement structures which are prefabricated and can be encased by concrete through SC3DP in a combined process. Based on the reinforcement concept of “reinforcement supports concrete,” the prefabricated cages support the concrete during application in a combined AM process. To demonstrate the huge potential of combined AM processes based on the SC3DP and WAAM techniques (for example, the manufacturing of individualized CPS), the so-called FLOWall is presented here. First, the form-finding process for the FLOWall concept based on fluid dynamic simulation is explained. For this, a three-step strategy is presented, which consists of (i) the 3D modelling of the element, (ii) the force-flow analysis, and (iii) the structural validation in a computational fluid dynamics software. From the finalized design, the printing phase is divided into two steps, one for the WAAM reinforcement and one for the SC3DP wall.

In the component based software development community, using EX-MAN component model (EX-MAN) a new incremental development process is proposed in this paper. With a new definition on increments, this proposed process is different and beneficial for building systems from existing components in a developer-friendly way. This claim is backed by comparing and contrasting the proposed work with the existing approaches in the component-based development domain.

In this regard, jobsites and laydown yards that involve construction materials such as gravel piles and crushed rocks could be the main sources of potential windborne debris during extreme wind events. To analyze safety risk and predict the damage imposed by jobsite debris to nearby built environments, a new computer vision-based risk assessment based on geometric digital twins of jobsite debris is proposed for the reliability analysis on glazing systems of dwellings located on nearby jobsites. The impact of a gravel pile in a railroad jobsite on nearby buildings and residential environments was studied based on extreme wind event scenarios, and the failure risk of the building glazing system was computed. The risk associated with jobsite debris during extreme wind events and their impact on neighboring communities are analyzed through three computing modules: (1) satellite imagery-based terrain modeling to study 3D characteristics of the at-risk built environment; (2) analyzing visual data from Google Street View to assess the risk associated with glazing panels of dwellings in the communities; and (3) analyzing visual data from a jobsite to quantify the impact of jobsite debris, to associate its safety risk to neighboring communities. The proposed method can provide an immediate heads up for those who reside nearby jobsites, allowing to take required preemptive actions to protect their habitation against potential windborne debris. Practitioners will also be informed of such jobsite debris-related risk before extreme wind events to better secure their jobsites for the risk mitigation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","3D modeling; Damage detection; Debris; Deep learning; E-learning; Gravel; Housing; Landslides; Piles; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Safety engineering; Seismology; Built environment; Extreme winds; Glazing systems; Gravel pile; Job sites; Safety risks; Vision based; Visual data; Wind events; Windborne debris; Reliability analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137717664"

The computational difficulties involved in Bayesian inference using intensive numerical models are circumvented by implementing a high-fidelity surrogate model and an adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. The developed surrogate model combines adaptive sparse polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) and Kriging meta-modelling. The optimal order of the polynomials in the PCE is automatically identified by a model selection technique for sparse linear models, the least-angle regression (LAR) algorithm. Then, the optimal PCE is inserted into a Kriging predictor as the trend term, while the stochastic term is fitted through a global optimization algorithm. Afterwards, the surrogate model bypassing the original numerical model is used for BMU exploiting monitoring data extracted from continuous ambient vibration measurements. The computational demands of the MCMC algorithm are kept minimal by implementing an adaptive Metropolis sampling with delayed rejection (DRAM). The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through three case studies: an analytical benchmark; a planar truss structure; and a real case study of an instrumented historical tower, the Sciri Tower in Italy. The presented results demonstrate that the proposed BMU approach is compatible with real-time Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), providing promising evidence for the development of digital twins with superior probabilistic damage identification capabilities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayesian inference; Damage localization; Operational modal analysis; Structural health monitoring; Surrogate models","Bayesian networks; Damage detection; Global optimization; Inference engines; Interpolation; Markov processes; Modal analysis; Numerical models; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Bayesian inference; Bayesian model updating; Chaos expansions; Damage Identification; Damage localization; Operational modal analysis; Polynomial chaos; Real- time; Sparse polynomials; Surrogate modeling; Structural health monitoring","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135876412"

Although the concept of Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) in the field of autonomous systems -such as satellites, has long been researched and developed, that is not the case for their ground systems. Both satellites and ground stations operate autonomously. The latter however, are not equipped with the advanced Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) capabilities one finds today on-board all orbiting spacecrafts. The aim of the study presented in this paper is the improvement of ground stations' operational diagnostics by providing the operators with ad-hock, Operations-Dedicated Models (ODMs). The latter serve as a basis for the construction of the system's Digital Twin (DT) models. These models allow the operators react more quickly and more precisely to alarms raised by the station. By helping the operators identify the malfunction and correct it in the quickest delays, they can avoid loosing the next satellite telemetry (TM) data, thus saving precious time and costs. This would increase both the availability and maintainability of the system. In a larger framework, ODMs are ideally concurrently built and connected with the engineering and safety models of the system, in a sort of virtual continuous improvement loop. While the utter purpose of ODMs is their usage as the system's DTs during operations, they also contribute to the stations' architecture and robustness continuous improvement, through increasing its fault detection and mitigation capabilities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Behaviour trees (BTs); Digital twins (DTs); Fault trees (FTs); Ground systems operations; MBSA; MBSE; Model-based diagnosis (MBD); Model-based operations (MBO); Operational diagnosis","Fault detection; Forestry; Satellite ground stations; Satellites; Behavior tree; Behaviour Trees; Digital twin; Fault tree; Fault-trees; Ground system operation; Ground systems; MBSA; MBSE; Model-based diagnose; Model-based diagnosis; Model-based OPC; Model-based operation; Operational diagnose; Systems operation; Orbits","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142931868"

This paper proposes a vision of a general framework for the design, deployment and operation of Digital Z (where Z can be model, shadow, twin, passport, avatar...). Different Digital Zs are used, often in combination, for various purposes during systems engineering. That is why we propose a family of architectures for different Digital Zs. Each Digital Z architecture is constructed based on the engineers' goals. These goals can always be reduced to the observation, satisfaction, or optimization of some Properties of Interest (PoIs). Example PoIs are safety, and average energy consumption. We propose to have one Digital Z architecture per PoI. The different Digital Zs may be combined into an ecosystem. More variability is introduced when we zoom into the deployment of Digital Zs. Common choices for network communication such as DDS and MQTT each have their own strengths and weaknesses which must be taken into account when trying to satisfy non-functional properties such as meeting real-time deadlines. We also introduce the Modelverse, a Virtual (Federated) Knowledge Graph (VKG). It is used as a source of knowledge to aid in the construction of ""experiments""which answer user's questions about PoIs. These, possibly concurrent, experiments are in essence particular Digital Z ecosystems/architectures. When the experiments provide answers, these are added to the VKG knowledge base in the form (question, experiment architecture, answer). The glue between the above is a template workflow. We sketch the above concepts by means of concrete examples and compare them with existing Digital Z definitions and frameworks such as the ""5D model"". © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital twins; System architectures; System engineering","Complex networks; Ecosystems; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Knowledge graph; Network architecture; Average energy; Complex workflows; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Knowledge graphs; Optimisations; Property; Systems architecture; Virtual knowledge; Workflow analysis; Systems engineering","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142927915"

Intelligent transportation can play a very important role in the joint prevention. This work expects to explore the building information modeling (BIM) big data (BD) processing method of digital twins (DTs) of Smart City, thus speeding up the construction of Smart City and improve the accuracy of data processing. During construction, DTs build the same digital copy of the smart city. On this basis, BIM designs the building's keel and structure, optimizing various resources and configurations of the building. Regarding the fast data growth in smart cities, a complex data fusion and efficient learning algorithm, namely Multi-Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), is proposed to process the multi-dimensional and complex BD based on the compositive rough set model. The Bayesian network solves the multi-label classification. Each label is regarded as a Bayesian network node. Then, the structural learning approach is adopted to learn the label Bayesian network's structure from data. On the P53-old and the P53-new datasets, the running time of Multi-GPU decreases as the number of GPUs increases, approaching the ideal linear speedup ratio. With the continuous increase of K value, the deterministic information input into the tag BN will be reduced, thus reducing the classification accuracy. When K = 3, MLBN can provide the best data analysis performance. On genbase dataset, the accuracy of MLBN is 0.982 ± 0.013. Through experiments, the BIM BD processing algorithm based on Bayesian Network Structural Learning (BNSL) helps decision-makers use complex data in smart cities efficiently. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayesian Network Structural Learning Algorithm; BIM; digital twins; multimedia big data; Smart City","Bayesian networks; Classification (of information); Complex networks; Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Data fusion; Data handling; Decision making; E-learning; Graphics processing unit; Information management; Learning algorithms; Program processors; Smart city; Bayesia n networks; Bayesian network structural learning algorithm; Building Information Modelling; City construction; City management; Complex data; Intelligent transportation; Multimedium big data; Structural learning; Virus disease; Big data","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131696198"

Firstly, the design flow and construction principle of digital twin of complex mining equipment were introduced, and the function of predictive maintenance system was realized in the process of building digital twin. Then, the status data acquisition method based on the LabVIEW, MySQL and Unity3D was studied, and the Unity3D development engine was used to build a three-dimensional visual status monitoring platform for complex mining equipment, and the current equipment status was visualized through virtual space. Finally, the applicability of optimized BP (back propagation) neural network in the fault warning of complex mining equipment was analyzed. At the same time, the predictive maintenance model of key parts of complex mining equipment was established by MATLAB software, and the warning results were transmitted to the Unity3D development engine through MySQL database to drive and deploy the preset maintenance process, so as to achieve the fault warning of key parts under the real-time monitoring of equipment status. According to the actual maintenance process of shearer hydraulic system, a mixed reality (MR) predictive maintenance strategy was formulated, and the effectiveness of the hydraulic plunger pump of shearer rocker arm was verified by taking it as the experimental object. The results showed that the fault prediction accuracy of the proposed predictive maintenance system was higher than 90%, and the fault warning results could drive HoloLens glasses to achieve the maintenance interaction of virtual guidance, which verified the effectiveness of the predictive maintenance function of the system.

To solve the above problems, it is necessary to obtain the status and trend changes information and provide information support for the optimization of decision-making and dynamic adjustment of the production system. However, the production system cognition faces the problems of state coupling, state dynamic transfer and transition, and multi-system interweaving, which makes the production system cognition face huge challenges. Combining technologies such as the Internet of Things, industrial big data, and artificial intelligence, cognitive manufacturing can realize dynamic cognition of the production process, support dynamic adjustment, and become a promising way to solve the dynamic changes and uncertainties of production systems. In addition, as a formal expression of information processing and knowledge learning process in cognitive informatics, the Object-Attribute-Relation (OAR) model can effectively guide the construction of the production process cognitive mechanism. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional cognitive framework based on OAR model of the human cognitive world for the dynamic cognitive needs of production system. The framework carries out dynamic cognition from the three dimensions of the manufacturing unit, production situation, and production system, and builds the continuous cognitive abilities from the three dimensions of analysis, decision-making, and learning. By integrating intelligent algorithms in the fields of artificial intelligence, a computable digital twin model is constructed as a carrier to provide the cognitive enabling technologies and capabilities for the production system. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed framework is illustrated by the developed computational digital twin platform. The computable digital twin platform provides the production system with important cognitive capabilities such as states perception, trend prediction, optimization decision-making, and knowledge learning, to support the dynamic cognition and optimization decision-making of the production system, and lay a technical foundation for adaptive production and cognitive manufacturing. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cognitive framework; Cognitive manufacturing; Computable digital twin; Intelligent manufacturing; Multi-dimensional; OAR model","Artificial intelligence; Cognitive systems; Decision making; Learning systems; Cognitive frameworks; Cognitive manufacturing; Computable digital twin; Decisions makings; Intelligent Manufacturing; Multi dimensional; Object attribute relations; Object-attribute-relation model; Production system; Relation models; Manufacture","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140781263"

The country with the highest number of citations is China with 717, followed by Australia and the USA with 549 and 513, respectively, but relativizing the number of citations based on various indices (human development index, gross national income per capita, and population-tertiary education level), Hong Kong (18.04), Australia (10.64), and Egypt (10.16) would take the top positions, respectively. Regarding universities, the entity that has generated the most references is Delft University of Technology (the Netherlands) with 15 papers, followed by University College London (UK) with 13. Finally, the results show that GIS and BIM and HBIM provide virtual 3D models with multiple applications for buildings and infrastructures. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BIM; building information modeling; digital twin; facility management; geographic information system; GIS; HBIM; heritage building information modeling","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140654502"

The utilisation of data from a built asset’s planning, design, and construction phases to the operations phase core and to the facility management function of building and integration in supporting core business and support services is frequently limited due to technical obstacles in information management. The paper presents the second of three stages of design science research to propose a conceptual approach for the implementation of the “as-a-service” method for the construction industry, namely “Building-as-a-Service” (BaaS). BaaS involves a shift in the concept of services: users become recipients of services generated by the building, not only services provided in the building. The paper shows the interdependencies between these various concepts and suggests a possible framework for the inclusion of these “as-a-Service” approaches for enabling a Digital Twin based on Building Information Modelling, which is becoming mandatory in several European states. The study gathered the foundational theoretical constructs through a literature review and elucidated them to make the proposed framework feasible. The theoretical foundations comprise Building Information Modelling (BIM), the Digital Twin (DT), the interconnecting technology of smart applications and the practical application in projects. The approach of “Building-as-a-Service” in combination with smart applications can be an approach to making the use of buildings available in a resource-saving way to clients, building owners and users. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Building Information Modelling; Building-as-a-Service; construction management; Digital Twin; facility management; information management","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140641679"

However, the majority of current multi-target classification of urban scenes uses only a single source data (optical remote sensing images or airborne laser scanning (ALS) point clouds), which is limited by the restricted information of the data source itself. In order to make full use of the information carried by multiple data sources, we often need to set more parameters as well as algorithmic steps. To address the above issues, we compared and analyzed the object classification methods based on data fusion of airborne LiDAR point clouds and optical remote sensing images, systematically. Firstly, the features were extracted and determined from airborne LiDAR point clouds and high-resolution optical images. Then, some key feature sets were selected and were composed of median absolute deviation of elevation, normalized elevation values, texture features, normal vectors, etc. The feature sets were fed into various classifiers, such as random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and support vector machines (SVM). Thirdly, the suitable feature sets with appropriate dimensionality were composed, and the point clouds were classified into four categories, such as trees (Tr), houses and buildings (Ho), low-growing vegetation (Gr), and impervious surfaces (Is). Finally, the single data source and multiple data sources, the crucial feature sets and their roles, and the resultant accuracy of different classifier models were compared and analyzed. Under the conditions of different experimental regions, sampling proportion parameters and machine learning models, the results showed that: (1) the overall classification accuracy obtained by the feature-level data fusion method was 76.2% compared with the results of only a single data source, which could improve the overall classification accuracy by more than 2%; (2) the accuracy of the four classes in the urban scenes can reach 88.5% (Is), 76.7% (Gr), 87.2% (Tr), and 88.3% (Ho), respectively, while the overall classification accuracy can reach 87.6% with optimal sampling parameters and random forest classifiers; (3) the RF classifier outperforms DT and SVM for the same sample conditions. In this paper, the method based on ALS point clouds and image data fusion can accurately classify multiple targets in urban scenes, which can provide technical support for 3D scene reconstruction and digital twin cities in complex geospatial environments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","airborne LiDAR point cloud; feature extraction; feature fusion; machine learning; point cloud classification","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139930014"

This study develops a Building Information Model (BIM)-supported framework to facilitate scan planning and motion planning of autonomous LiDAR-carrying UAVs. The proposed framework selectively integrates the geometry and semantics from BIM to construct a probabilistic 3D voxel map. Then, a greedy algorithm is developed to iteratively generate waypoints with optimized coverage. After that, a collision-free guiding path is computed for traversing all the waypoints before it is further transformed into a high-degree polynomial trajectory. The proposed framework was validated in a simulated construction scenario of water treatment facilities using MATLAB and Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). The planned trajectory demonstrated smoothness, energy efficiency, and sufficient coverage. It reduced 86.17% of required moments from motors over the regular A* algorithm and achieved 91.67% scan coverage on the target facility. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BIM; Digital twin; LiDAR; Motion planning; Scan planning; UAV","Aircraft detection; Antennas; Architectural design; Energy efficiency; Iterative methods; Optical radar; Semantics; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Water treatment; Aerial vehicle; Building Information Modelling; Flight planning; Laser scanning; Light detection and ranging; Motion-planning; Point-to-point navigation; Scan planning; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Waypoints; Motion planning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137095856"

As-built BIMs can reflect the actual conditions of facilities and thus as-built BIM reconstruction has shown great significance in digital twin generation, building health monitoring, facility management and urban renewal. Laser scanners are capable to capture dense 3D measurements of the environment in a fast and highly accurate way. Therefore, laser scanning data have been widely used for as-built BIM generation. Although research efforts have been made on how to automatically achieve “Scan-to-BIM”, there are still gaps from applying current solutions to real scenarios. One of the challenges is that some irrelevant point clusters may be wrongly recognized as the desired object in the detection stage. This study presents a novel object verification approach based on deep learning point feature comparison to improve the accuracy of automated BIM reconstruction process. Firstly, a KPConv-based deep neural network is developed and trained to perform 3D point feature computation. Then through comparing point features calculated for extracted point clusters and as-designed BIM generated point clouds, point feature distance maps are generated. Afterwards, to automatically analyze the generated feature distance maps, a dataset including simulated positive and negative instances is created based on ModelNet40. And a tiny neural network is established and trained on the prepared dataset to acquire ability of distinguishment. To validate the feasibility of the proposed technique, experiments were conducted on both artificial point clouds and real scan data collected in one MEP room in a water treatment work in Hong Kong. It is demonstrated that the proposed technique can successfully filter out all the false positives in the Scan-to-BIM process, improving reconstruction accuracy significantly. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","As-built modeling; Building information model (BIM); Deep learning; LiDAR point clouds; Object verification","Deep neural networks; Object detection; Office buildings; Water treatment; As-build modeling; Building information model; Building Information Modelling; Deep learning; LiDAR point cloud; Modeling reconstruction; Object verification; Point clusters; Point features; Point-clouds; Architectural design","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135386047"

The goal of the transparent DT-BRB is not only to model the complex relationships between the system inputs and output but also to conduct output control by identifying and optimizing the key parameters in the model inputs. The proposed DT-BRB approach is composed of three major steps. First, BRB is adopted to model the relationships between the inputs and output of the physical system. Second, an analytical procedure is proposed to identify only the key parameters in the system inputs with the highest contribution to the output. Being consistent with the inferencing, integration, and unification procedures of BRB, there are also three parts in the contribution calculation in this step. Finally, the data-driven optimization is performed to control the system output. A practical case study on the Wuhan Metro System is conducted for reducing the building tilt rate (BTR) in tunnel construction. By comparing the results following different standards, the 80% contribution standard is proved to have the highest marginal contribution that identifies only 43.5% parameters as the key parameters but can reduce the BTR by 73.73%.

The analysis considers keywords, co-author, co-citation, and clustering analysis. This study used 1320 documents, including journals and conference proceedings from the Scopus database, where 753 were for cross-laminated timber and 567 for Industry 4.0.

One widespread technique to accomplish dependability and, in particular, resilience, is replication.

The related technologies of quantum communication are introduced to improve network communication. Firstly, the key DTs technologies in the construction of IIoT are expounded. Also, the characteristics of quantum communication are analyzed. Secondly, a channel encryption scheme based on quantum communication is proposed to ensure the communication security of IIoT. The scheme uses the five-particle entanglement state and two-particle bell state as entanglement channels to realize two-particle quantum teleportation. Finally, an Adaptive Key Residue algorithm is proposed based on the quantum key distribution mechanism. The algorithm verification suggests that the success rate of service distribution decreases with the increase in network load. When the service load reaches 1000, the Adaptive Key Residue algorithm can maintain a success rate of service distribution in the network higher than 0.6. Besides, the success rate of service distribution increases with the growth of the total key generation rate V and the key pool capacity C. The research results reported here are of great significance for realizing the secure communication of IIoT systems based on digital twins to ensure the effective operation of network communication and the secure transmission of data. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Network security; Quantum cryptography; Quantum entanglement; Channel encryption; Communications security; Encryption schemes; Entanglement state; Key residues; Network communications; Particle entanglement; Quantum networking; Service distribution; Two particles; Quantum communication","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144259204"

The aim of this paper was to propose a software architecture and to develop a framework of smart contracts for blockchain-based digital twin (BCDT) dApps throughout the lifecycle of projects in CI 4.0. This paper leveraged the existing literature and action research interviews to identify and validate the critical industry problems, functional requirements (FRs), and non-functional requirements (NFRs) to be addressed by BCDT dApps in CI 4.0. Basic use cases were developed to design a framework of smart contracts for BCDT dApps throughout the lifecycle of projects. The analysis of an online survey was used to identify the key requirements and enablers to propose a software architecture for BCDT applications and to validate the requirements for developing the framework of a smart contract for BCDTs. The findings were: (1) The identification of key problems in CI 4.0 for each BIM/BCDT dimension (3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D, 8D, and contractual (cD)) and the related FRs and NFRs for BCDT applications. Additionally, key use cases were designed to address the problems identified. (2) The proposed BCDT architecture permitted us to narrow gaps in the literature on blockchain-based decentralized digital twins. Moreover, the proposed BCDT architecture and smart-contract framework addressed the main requirements in the literature on BCDTs. (3) The study leveraged the non-fungible token (NFT) standard to develop a framework for smart contracts that addressed the key use cases and the related industry problems and functional requirements that were identified. The study also considered the contractual dimension (cD) as an overarching dimension in relation to the other BCDT dimensions. (4) We also compared the costs of several public blockchains for executing the proposed smart-contract framework throughout the lifecycle of a medium-sized building project. The cost analysis permitted the development of criteria to evaluate the suitability of blockchain networks for BCDT applications in CI 4.0 depending on the principal blockchain networks’ properties (security, decentralization, scalability, and interoperability).

The most critical issue in data aggregation is data aggregation scheduling. This problem becomes even cumbersome when considered to obtain minimum latency and collision in the networks where fixed amount of data can be aggregated. Many researches have been conducted to resolve the issue of data delivery with low latency and collision. Though, some methods nearly achieved this objective but at the cost of increased complexity. Also, many works assume the system to be centralized having knowledge of every related device in the network. Practically, WSNs are likely to be distributed where each device's information is dissociated from the other. In this context, a data aggregation scheduling algorithm is proposed to aggregate the data from a tree-based distributed sensor network. An effective aggregation tree construction based on Dijkstra's algorithm is adopted which avoids the chance of re-transmission of data. Furthermore, a new collision prevention scheduling (CPS) algorithm is designed which ensures the data aggregation through non-collision schedules using minimum time slots. The proposed method shows 54.74% less aggregation latency compared to its competitor data aggregation scheduling approach. The outcome of extensive simulations confirms the efficiency and good performance of the proposed algorithm over previous works. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data aggregation scheduling; Data aggregation tree; Dijkstra's algorithm; Distributed sensor networks; Wireless sensor networks","Scheduling algorithms; Sensor nodes; Trees (mathematics); Critical issues; Data aggregation; Data aggregation scheduling; Data aggregation tree; Data delivery; Dijkstra's algorithms; Distributed sensor networks; Low latency; Sink nodes; Wireless sensor network applications; Scheduling","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135418866"

In the case of the built environment, the PT is represented by smart buildings and infrastructures. Full synchronization between the DT and the PT will allow for a perpetual learning process and updating between the two twins. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of DT called risk-informed digital twin (RDT). In the DT the model predictions are developed through data-driven tools and algorithms. However, multiple sources of uncertainty during the lifecycle challenge our understanding and ability to effectively model the performance of the modeled systems. The RDT's importance lies in its integration of the methods and tools of statistics and risk analysis with machine learning. To this aim, the platform incorporates a novel framework of data-driven uncertainty quantification and risk analysis rooted in information theory. At the core of the RDT is a framework of sustainable and resilient based engineering (SRBE), introduced in this work and considered the first step toward the extension of performance-based engineering (PBE) approaches to socioecological-technical systems under uncertainty. A risk-informed multicriteria decision support tool able to incorporate social aspects is also included, and it can be used for sustainable and resilient design in the early stage, or management under uncertainty of smart buildings and infrastructure systems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Decision support systems; Information theory; Learning systems; Life cycle; Risk assessment; Social aspects; Uncertainty analysis; Building process; Building structure; Building systems; Built environment; Data driven; Process structures; Process system; Real-world; Uncertainty; Urban community; Risk analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133366441"

There is a compelling need to establish DTs as practice in AEC by developing common procedures and standards tailored to the sector's procedures and use cases.

Our approach combines structure from motion (SfM) with deep-learning-based segmentation techniques. Given multiple-view images of a building, we compute a three-dimensional (3D) planar abstraction (LOD2 model) of its point cloud using SfM techniques. To obtain LOD3 models, we use deep learning to perform semantic segmentation of the openings in the two-dimensional (2D) images. Unlike existing approaches, we do not rely on complex input, pre-defined 3D shapes or manual intervention. To demonstrate the robustness of our method, we show that it can generate 3D building shapes from a collection of building images with no further input. For evaluating reconstructions, we also propose two novel metrics. The first is a Euclidean–distance-based correlation of the 3D building model with the point cloud. The second involves re-projecting 3D model facades onto source photos to determine dice scores with respect to the ground-truth masks.

However, it is still a challenging work to deploy DNNs in real-time systems. In particular, the execution time of DNN inference must be predictable, s.t. it could be known whether the runtime inference can complete within a required timing constraint. Moreover, the timing constraints may change dynamically with the runtime environment in many embedded applications, such as autonomous cars. A possible way to meet such dynamic real-time requirements is to execute different subnetworks of a DNN at runtime. However, improper construction of subnetworks may not only introduce unpredictable inference time, s.t. the real-timing constraints could be violated unexpectedly, but also has poor compatibility with the well-optimized machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow). In this article, we study the predictability when executing different subnetworks of a DNN. In particular, we present a featurewise runtime adaptation framework for DNN inference, which is implemented and validated on NVIDIA Jetson TX2 and Nano with TensorFlow. The experimental results show that our method can achieve predictable inference time in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep neural network (DNN); predictability; pruning; runtime","Deep neural networks; Embedded systems; Interactive computer systems; Job analysis; Convolutional neural network; Kernel; Network inference; Predictability.; Pruning; Real - Time system; Runtimes; Subnetworks; Task analysis; Timing constraints; Real time systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117816933"

While task-specific solutions may eliminate the respective issue in certain applications, finding a generic method for missing data estimation is rather complex. In this regard, this article proposes a novel missing data imputation algorithm, which has supreme generalization ability for a vast variety of applications. Making use of both complete and incomplete parts of data, the proposed algorithm reduces the effect of missing ratio, which makes it suitable for situations with very high missing ratios. In addition, this feature enables model construction on incomplete training sets, which is rarely addressed in the literature. Moreover, the nonparametric nature of this new algorithm brings about supreme flexibility against all variations of missing values and data distribution. We incorporate the advantages of denoising autoencoders and ladder architecture into a novel formulation based on deep neural networks. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, a comparative study is performed using a number of reputable imputation techniques. In this process, real-world benchmark datasets from different domains are selected. On top of that, a real cyber-physical system is also evaluated to study the generalization ability of the proposed algorithm for distinct applications. To do so, we conduct studies based on three missing data mechanisms, namely: 1) missing completely at random; 2) missing at random; and 3) missing not at random.

First presented is the overview of the context and justification of why botanically accurate plants and landscapes are important for educational applications, such as for use in museums, arboretums, and field trip experiences to botanical gardens. Connected to that goal is the importance of accuracy in visualization of not only the plant, but the entire virtual model of the landscape using plant inventory data and plant population density geographical information system (GIS) data. This then touches on the important issues for digital twins, as models and simulations of reality. Educational applications are different than entertainment application in the dimensions of information fidelity, or the trustworthiness of the presentation, and also the graphical fidelity, or the photorealistic capacity of the rendering systems. These are not always the same. High graphical fidelity is a byproduct of high information fidelity; the reverse is not always true. High graphical fidelity enhances information fidelity, if used for that purpose. Two immersive informal learning applications use cases are presented, one for augmented reality (AR), and the other as a virtual reality (VR) example. Both models used the same design and development process, integrating domain expertise, the botanist and the ecologist, with the art and software team to enhance the accuracy. Co-design, highly iterative review process, removes errors in educational content, and representation, as well as usability and may be generalized to any domain when learning is a goal of a digital twin. In this work it is referred to as the Expert-Learner-User-Experience (ELUX) design process. Game engines, as general purpose visualization tools, make multimodal and interaction possible to enhance user experiences and to make semantic material accessible to the learner. The technical constrains on the application design demanded two production pipelines. The AR and VR pipeline required low-polygon models for performance, and the newly released Unreal Engine 5 and Reality Capture created an opportunity to increase the graphical fidelity and the information fidelity of the plants and models. Virtual nature construction methods are covered in two processes, first with low-polygon 3D plant models ideal for AR and VR, and the second with high-polygon 3D plant models using Unreal Engine 5 and Reality Capture. As highly accurate 3D plant models, combined with stat of the art rendering for photorealistic models, when combined with GIS geospatial datasets, and visualized in immersive devices, digital twins of the natural world become possible. Once these models are connected to mathematical models of the natural world, dynamics driven by real time data feeds, and forecasts, both back in time and forward into the future will enhance our understanding of the natural world, and how it interacts with that of the artificial man-made world. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","3D modeling; Data visualization; E-learning; Geometry; Iterative methods; Photogrammetry; Pipelines; Plants (botany); Population statistics; Semantics; Technology transfer; Three dimensional computer graphics; Virtual reality; Visualization; 3D models; 3D plant modeling; 3d-modeling; Educational Applications; Geographical information; Immersive; Information fidelity; Natural world; Photo-realistic; Plant model; Augmented reality","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137150120"

Recently, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach has shown potential for addressing such adaptive task allocation. It remains unanswered, however, whether or not DRL can address adaptive task allocation problems in dynamic robotic construction environments. In this paper, we developed and tested a digital twin-driven DRL learning method to explore the potential of DRL for adaptive task allocation in robotic construction environments. Specifically, the digital twin synthesizes sensory data from physical assets and is used to simulate a variety of dynamic robotic construction site conditions within which a DRL agent can interact. As a result, the agent can learn an adaptive task allocation strategy that increases project performance. We tested this method with a case project in which a virtual robotic construction project (i.e., interlocking concrete bricks are delivered and assembled by robots) was digitally twinned for DRL training and testing. Results indicated that the DRL model's task allocation approach reduced construction time by 36% in three dynamic testing environments when compared to a rule-based imperative model. The proposed DRL learning method promises to be an effective tool for adaptive task allocation in dynamic robotic construction environments. Such an adaptive task allocation method can help construction robots cope with uncertainties and can ultimately improve construction project performance by efficiently prioritizing assigned tasks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive Task Allocation; Autonomous Robot; Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL); Digital Twin; Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)","Deep learning; E-learning; Learning systems; Robots; Adaptive task allocations; Construction environment; Construction projects; Deep reinforcement learning; Learning methods; Policy optimization; Project performance; Proximal policy optimization; Reinforcement learnings; Robotic construction; Reinforcement learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135829295"

However, the digital twin is becoming more and more complex due to the expansion of need on the simulation of multi-scale and multi-scenario in reality. The instance of digital twin in references mostly concentrates a particular application, while it is still a lack of a method for constructing the complex digital twin in the total elements, the variable scale of working environments, changeable process, not even the coupling effects. In this paper, a novel modeling method for such a complex digital twin is proposed based on the standardized processing on the model division and assembly. Firstly, the complex model of digital twin is divided into several simple models according to the composition, context, component, and code in 4C architecture. Composition and context make the digital twin focus on the effective elements in a specific scale and scenario. Component and code develop the digital twin in standard-based modularization. Secondly, assemble the simple models of digital twins into the complex model through information fusion, multi-scale association and multi-scenarios iterations. Ontology establishes the complete information library of the entities on different digital twins. Knowledge graph bridges the structure relationship between the different scales of digital twins. The scenario iterations realize the behavior interaction and the accuracy calculation results. It provides an implementable method to construct a complex model of digital twin, and the reuse of components and code also enables rapid development of digital twins. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Complex digital twin; Digital twin modeling; Simple digital twin; Smart manufacturing","Digital libraries; Knowledge graph; Complex digital twin; Complex model; Digital twin modeling; Model method; Multi scenarios; Multi-scales; Simple digital twin; Simple modeling; Simple++; Smart manufacturing; Modular construction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135285805"

Due to the lack of an operational application architecture model, it is impossible to map the complex system comprehensively. Based on the review of the concept model of DT and the current research situation in the smart grid (SG), an OKDD [i.e., ontology-body (OB), knowledge-body (KB), data-body (DB), and digital-portal (DP)] model of digital twin body (DTB) is proposed and specified in detail.

The approach is proved to be feasible preliminarily. This model provides a novel method for the unified description and standardization of DTB, which is conducive to the hierarchical creation (unit-system-system of systems) for complex systems. Meanwhile, it can represent complex physical entities more comprehensively, and enable the reuse of knowledge and the duplication of similar unit-level DTB rapidly.

Developing the generation IV nuclear power plant requires NGAI to fulfill intelligent operation and thereby enhance reliability and safety. Nevertheless, the NGAI based on machine computing is limited in auto-cognition whereas humans are adept in information processing. Operation states prediction is served as a specific scene to investigate the key enabling technologies (KETs) in HCPS, where humans are elevated to a supervisory level for NGAI technologies. Humans interact with NGAI in two-stage which comprise the initial construction and later upgradation of an intelligent prediction framework. In this paper, asymmetric multitask learning (AMTL) is elaborated as a KET which is essential to implementing intelligent prediction in HCPS. AMTL simultaneously trains multi-tasks and permits asymmetric information transfer between tasks. The amount of transfer varies with inter-task relatedness and individual task losses, thereby preventing negative transfer and enhancing accuracy. Furthermore, the improved AMTL is adapted for the small and imbalanced samples of tasks. A sparse and directed regularisation graph is introduced to visualise the correlation between tasks, reflecting the physical mechanism as well. Finally, the improved AMTL is utilized to predict reactivity of a specific pressurised water reactor (PWR), which validates the efficiency and accuracy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asymmetric multitask learning (AMTL); Human–cyber–physical system (HCPS); Nuclear reactor; Operation predicting; Regularization graph","Directed graphs; Embedded systems; Forecasting; Learning systems; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Pressurized water reactors; Artificial intelligence technologies; Asymmetric multitask learning; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Enabling technologies; Human–cybe–physical system; Multitask learning; Operation predicting; Regularisation; Regularization graph; Cyber Physical System","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134887295"

However, the limited wireless resource and security concerns impede the deployment of the digital twin in IoT. In this article, we exploit blockchain to propose a new digital twin edge networks framework for enabling flexible and secure digital twin construction. We first develop cooperative federated learning through an access point (AP) to help resource-limited smart devices in constructing digital twin at the network edges belonging to different mobile network operators (MNOs). Then, we propose a model update chain by leveraging directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain to secure both local model updates and global model updates. In order to incentivize the APs to help in local models training for resource-limited smart devices and also encourage the APs to contribute resource in local model update verification, we design an iterative double auction-based joint cooperative federated learning and local model update verification scheme. The optimal unified time for cooperative federated learning and local model update verification is solved to maximize social welfare. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed scheme is efficient in digital twin construction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; cooperative federated learning; digital twin edge networks; directed acyclic graph (DAG); iterative double auction","Digital devices; Directed graphs; E-learning; Internet of things; Network security; Acyclic graphs; Block-chain; Cooperative federated learning; Digital twin edge network; Directed acyclic graph; Double auction; EDGE Networks; Iterative double auction; Local model; Model updates; Blockchain","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133250305"

To explore current perceptions of long-term monitoring in civil and structural engineering, a multi-national survey of 146 participants was conducted to understand perceived uncertainties within the existing civil/structural engineering design process, perceptions of long-term monitoring, and the potential for the future integration and use of long-term monitoring in the civil/structural engineering design process. This study highlights that while views of long-term monitoring as a tool within the engineering design process are broadly positive, there is a wide disparity on its current implementation in practice, little agreement on how it may offer the greatest benefit to civil and structural engineering design, and a current lack of direct financial incentive to prompt its use within industry. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Construction 4.0; Digital twins; Long-term monitoring; Questionnaire; Structural engineering; Survey","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131952030"

Data and models, which have been proven in previous studies, are the core and foundation of the digital twin. However, most of the digital twin solutions have limitations in real settings. Previous models often neglected to provide a detailed description of the components or operational rules of the digital twin, which poses limits for practitioners. This is because there is not a completely unified understanding of the digital twin and not enough in-depth analysis of its components.

By offering these building blocks as a service via a DT Platform (a Digital Twin Environment), the technical barriers among SMEs to adopt these technologies are lowered.

Cyber-physical system (CPS) frameworks used to monitor and automate infrastructure systems in smart cities can be extended to sense people to better understand how they use infrastructure systems including social infrastructure (e.g., parks, markets). This paper adopts convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to automate the detection and spatiotemporal mapping of people using camera data to form a cyber-physical-social system (CPSS) for smart cities. The Mask region based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) detector was adopted and tailored to identify and segment human subjects in real time using camera images with an average speed of 7 frames per second. The Mask R-CNN framework was trained end to end using the Objects in Public Open Spaces (OPOS) image data set that includes classified segmentations of people in public spaces. A two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2D-3D) lifting algorithm based on a monocular camera calibration model was also employed to accurately position detected people in space. Finally, a Hungarian assignment algorithm based on association metrics extracted from detected people was used to assign people to spatiotemporal trajectories. To demonstrate the proposed framework, this study used the Detroit riverfront parks to study how people utilize community parks, which are a form of social infrastructure. The Mask R-CNN detector is proven precise in detecting and classifying the behavior of people in parks with mean average precision well above 85% for all class types defined in the OPOS library.

Thus, the structural health of the crane boom should be monitored in real time to ensure that it works under the designed load capacity. In this study, we developed a lightweight digital twin by the multifidelity surrogate (MFS) model to improve the real-time monitoring and prediction accuracy of the structural safety of a crane boom. Digital twin technology, which can establish real-time mapping between the physical space and the digital space, has a promising potential for online monitoring and analysis of structures, equipment, and even human bodies. By combining the MFS model and sensor data, the lightweight digital twin can dynamically mirror the crane boom postures and predict its structural performance in real time. In this study, the structural analysis of the crane boom is limited to the linear elastic stage of materials. Numerical experiments showed that the accuracy of the lightweight digital twin was enhanced compared with that established by the single-fidelity surrogate model, and the computational cost of the lightweight digital twin was decreased with respect to the digital twin built by the numerical method.

A quantitative research technique was utilised. This study used well-structured questionnaires which were forwarded to numerous CPs in the Southwest of Nigeria. A total of 150 questionnaires were sent out and 135 were received back from respondents. The research revealed some major approaches to conflict resolution among the CPs, such as collaborating, accommodating, negotiating, compromising, mediating, arbitrating, mediating-arbitrating, contending, obliging, early neutral evaluation and avoiding. This study is limited to construction professionals (CPs) that are members of Nigerian professional bodies and just 135 respondents took part in the survey. This study recommends that further studies should use other analysis methods to assess conflict resolution techniques among the CPs. The results from this study will enhance the knowledge of CPs in Nigeria of numerous methods of resolving conflict. Furthermore, the outcomes will help CPs make use of collaborating and accommodating in settling conflict within their individual professional bodies. Previous studies on conflict resolution methods only concentrated on contractors and consultants in construction projects but this present study contributes to the body of knowledge by assessing conflict resolution methods among CPs within their individual professional bodies. Additionally, the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) utilised in this study is novel since previous studies have not employed this analysis method. Therefore, it is recommended that CPs should be collaborating with one another in order to solidify their relationship and enhance their performance within their professional bodies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","conflict; conflict resolution (CR) methods; construction industry (CI); construction professionals (CPs); Nigeria; professional bodies","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132902846"

However, the hoisting operation has a certain degree of randomness and invisibility, and it is extremely dangerous to carry out the experiment on the construction site, which makes the research on the relevant regularity very scarce. To simulate different hoisting behaviors as realistically as possible and analyze their dynamic effects on the tower crane, a digital twin (DT) framework of human–machine interaction construction activities is constructed based on the scale model in this study. Through experimental study, the stability change law of the tower crane with the incremental dynamic load is obtained based on the collapse probability level function. Experiment results show that tilt hoisting is the most dangerous behavior causing the tower crane instability. Tower crane foundation and masts are the most vulnerable components to be disturbed by unsafe hoisting behaviors, which can be used as key areas for sensor deployment. This paper can support the detection of the dangerous parts of the tower crane structure, and the monitoring system design for unsafe hoisting behaviors will be carried out in the future. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin; Scale model; Tower crane stability; Unsafe hoisting behaviors","Construction industry; Dynamic loads; Tower cranes; Towers; Construction activities; Construction sites; Degree of randomness; Dynamic effects; Human machine interaction; Safety accidents; Scale-model; Stability analyze; Tower crane stability; Unsafe hoisting behavior; Stability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128401631"

However, empirical evidence on such adoption is fragmented, particularly for facility management (FM) activities during the O&M phase. Considering this gap, an illustrative case study approach is performed to analyze and compare the traditional practices of FM with DT-driven FM during the O&M phase using four geospatially representative cases. The findings show that DT technologies enable efficient and responsive planning and control of FM activities by providing real-time status of the building assets. However, barriers such as the misalignment of the data integration and data standards hamper their future implementation. To address this, a bottom-up conceptual framework is proposed to facilitate a wider implementation of DT technologies and support FM during the O&M phase of buildings. As such, this paper's contribution is twofold: (1) it provides an aggregate landscape of DT application to manage facilities during the O&M phase, and (2) it develops an evidence-induced conceptual framework for stakeholders who are grappling with their FM decision-making processes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Building information modelling; Case study; Conceptual framework; Digital twin; Facility management","Data integration; Decision making; Frequency modulation; Information management; Life cycle; Building Information Modelling; Building maintenance; Building operations; Case-studies; Conceptual frameworks; Facilities management; Maintenance process; Management activities; Operation process; Operations and maintenance; Office buildings","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123012263"

Literature envisions the potential of digital twinning applications in the urban realm and discusses the cognitive city model and its implications on the future of our cities, its urban realm and the built environment in general. With the evolving themes on the ideal future city model, this systematic review tackles the following questions: what are the key motives and drivers of the future city paradigm; what is a city digital twin; and what are their expected applications. Additionally, how literature envisions the definition of the city users and their experience in the urban realm of the city of the future.

Recently, various efforts have been promoting mobile crowd-sensing (such as a community with people using mobile devices) as a way to collect data based on existing resources. A Mobile Crowd-Sensing System can be considered as a Cyber-Physical System (CPS), because it allows people with mobile devices to collect and supply data to CPSs' centers. In practical mobile crowd-sensing applications, due to limited budgets for the different expenditure categories in the system, it is necessary to minimize the collection of redundant information to save more resources for the investor. We study the problem of selecting participants in Mobile Crowd-Sensing Systems without redundant information such that the number of users is minimized and the number of records (events) reported by users is maximized, also known as the Participant-Report-Incident Redundant Avoidance (PRIRA) problem. We propose a new approximation algorithm, called the Maximum-Participant-Report Algorithm (MPRA) to solve the PRIRA problem. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and experimentation, we demonstrate that our proposed method performs well within reasonable bounds of computational complexity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data redundancy; mobile crowd-sensing; optimization; participatory sensing","Approximation algorithms; Budget control; Data acquisition; Embedded systems; Human computer interaction; Redundancy; Application data; Data challenges; Data collection method; Data solutions; Data-redundancy; Mobile crowd-sensing; Optimisations; Participatory Sensing; Sensing applications; Sensing systems; Wireless sensor networks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130342408"

Many technologies, such as the Building Information Model (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT), etc., are concerned with virtual representation and manipulation of the physical site. However, a holistic view of the off-site construction processes is lacking in the exploration of the technological advances, resulting in inconsistency when applying these advances in practice. The concept of Digital Twin is useful for addressing this challenge. Digital Twin is a philosophy and a collection of technologies aimed toward seamless physical and virtual connections. Therefore, a holistic Off-site Construction Digital Twin model is necessary for any research concerning this topic, and an assessment framework is useful in helping off-site construction industry companies in approaching systematic Digital Twin. This research first proposes a model for Off-site Construction Digital Twin. To quantify this model, an assessment tool named Off-site Construction Digital Twin Maturity Level is proposed. The validation and evaluation of this assessment framework are conducted through a case study with ACQBuilt, an off-site construction company in Edmonton, Canada. The resulting assessment framework contributes to the body of knowledge in two ways: Firstly, it sets the foundation for an Off-site Construction Digital Twin, which is anticipated to significantly reduce waste and to improve efficiency. Secondly, it enables easier technology application in practice by offering a holistic Digital Twin framework. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","assessment framework; Digital Twin; maturity level; off-site construction; Off-site Construction Digital Twin; Virtual Design Construction; wood panelized construction","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129988316"

This study investigates the current status and future trends in building information modeling (BIM) literature from the Web of Science database. This review systematically uses bibliometric and systematic literature review (SLR) methods through co-occurrence and co-citation analysis. First, 650 academic documents were retrieved from the Web of Science database. Then, co-occurrence and co-citation analyses were performed along with network visualization to examine research interconnections’ patterns. As a result, relevant keywords, productive authors, and important journals have been highlighted. The prominent research topics within the literature on building information modelling focus on the following topics: collaborative in BIM, integration of BIM, GIS and Internet of Things (IoT), barriers to the integration of BIM, sustainability and BIM, and risk assessment and uncertainty. Finally, the potential research directions are developing towards digital twin technology, integration of BIM and AI, and Augmented Reality (AR) and BIM. The presented findings of only 88 articles discuss the collaboration and risk issue in BIM for the construction industry and thus confirms the need for more studies on this topic to enhance the chances of successfully building information modelling projects.

A digital twin reproduces a real tunnel scene in virtual space and provides new means for tunnel digital maintenance. Aiming at the existing problems of video fragmentation, separation of video and business data, and lack of two-and three-dimensional linkage response methods in tunnel digital operation, in this paper, we propose a novel method for tunnel digital twin construction and virtual-real integration operation. Firstly, the digital management requirements of tunnel operations are systematically analyzed to clarify the purpose of digital twin construction. Secondly, BIM technology is used to construct a static model of the tunnel scene that conforms to the real tunnel main structure. Thirdly, a three-dimensional registration and projection calculation method is proposed to integrate tunnel surveillance video into a three-dimensional virtual scene in real time. Fourthly, multi-source sensing data are gathered and fused to form a digital twin scene that is basically the same as the real tunnel traffic operations scene. Finally, a management model suitable for digital twins is discussed to improve the efficiency of tunnel operations and management, and a tunnel in China is selected to verify this method. The results show that the proposed method is helpful to realize the application of two-and three-dimensional linkages of tunnel traffic smooth, accident rescue, facility management, and emergency response, and to improve the efficiency of tunnel digital management. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital twin; tunnel traffic; video fusion; virtual-real fusion","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129131859"

IC (Intelligent compaction) is an emerging and developing technology that can overcome the limitations of current quality control and quality assurance approaches, such as detection hysteresis and incompleteness. However, IC is mainly used in a vehicle system to realize real-time quality inspection, while its further potential is not fully exerted in advanced construction control and management as a comprehensive, continuous and nondestructive testing tool. This paper proposes a BIM (Building Information Model)-IoT (Internet of things) and IC integrated framework to provide a fundamental platform for advanced compaction quality monitoring and management. Specifically, BIM provides high-fidelity virtual assets of road infrastructure for data integration, visualization and construction organization management. IC is used to provide comprehensive compaction quality monitoring data and quality control methods. IoT (Internet of things) is adopted to connect physical and cyber assets by capturing real-time data from the actual operations in construction. Finally, a prototype system is developed as an implementation of the framework. The case demonstration of the system shows that the proposed framework can effectively integrate BIM and IC to realize the monitoring of road compaction quality and data in combination with IoT data, and the construction schedule can be rearranged and optimized based on the monitoring results. This study can facilitate to realize road compaction quality real-time monitoring and management, as well to offer a basic BIM-IoT platform that can be utilized as a prototype of road infrastructure digital twin to achieve more intelligent and sustainable management of the entire construction process in the future. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BIM; Compaction quality monitoring; Construction management; Intelligent compaction; IoT","Architectural design; Compaction; Construction equipment; Construction industry; Data visualization; Highway administration; Highway planning; Information management; Inspection; Integrated circuits; Internet of things; Monitoring; Nondestructive examination; Quality assurance; Roads and streets; Building Information Modelling; Compaction qualities; Compaction quality monitoring; Construction management; Control and management; Integrated frameworks; Intelligent compactions; Monitoring and management; Quality monitoring; Road infrastructures; Data integration","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127749312"

Therefore, research on the smart factory DTS (SFDTS) construction and application with cross-domain, multiple models have important influence on smart manufacturing.

The blocks partially constructed with secure data from smart devices by fog servers are provided to cloud servers that are responsible for completing blocks, and then mining those blocks for verification and addition in the blockchain. The most important application of the private blockchain construction is to apply AI algorithms for accurate predictions in Big data analytics.

Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems create the heart of buildings. Stable air handling unit (AHU) functioning is vital to ensuring high efficiency and extending the life of HVAC systems. This research proposes a Digital Twin predictive maintenance framework of AHU to overcome the limitations of facility maintenance management (FMM) systems now in use in buildings. Digital Twin technology, which is still at an initial stage in the facility management industry, use Building Information Modeling (BIM), Internet of things (IoT) and semantic technologies to create a better maintenance strategy for building facilities. Three modules are implemented to perform a predictive maintenance framework: operating fault detection in AHU based on the APAR (Air Handling Unit Performance Assessment Rules) method, condition prediction using machine learning techniques, and maintenance planning. Furthermore, the proposed framework was tested in a real-world case study with data between August 2019 and October 2021 for an educational building in Norway to validate that the method was feasible. Inspection information and previous maintenance records are also obtained through the FM system. The results demonstrate that the continually updated data combined with APAR and machine learning algorithms can detect faults and predict the future state of Air Handling Unit (AHU) components, which may assist in maintenance scheduling. Removing the detected operating faults resulted in annual energy savings of several thousand dollars due to eliminating the identified operating faults. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air handling unit; APAR; Digita twin; Facility management; Internet of things; Predictive maintenance","Air conditioning; Architectural design; Condition based maintenance; Construction industry; Energy efficiency; Fault detection; Information management; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Machine components; Machine learning; Maintenance; Semantics; Air handling unit performance assessment rule; Air-handling unit; Conditioning systems; Digita twin; Facilities management; Heating ventilation and air conditioning; Performance assessment rules; Predictive maintenance; Unit-based; Office buildings","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125646504"

Using a structured questionnaire, data were collected from built environment professionals in the Gauteng province of South Africa. Data collected was analysed using a five-stage process which includes: data reliability and validity, descriptive statistics, establishing a difference in groups’ opinion, principal component analysis, and model testing and fit statistics for confirmatory factor analysis. Results from the study indicate that three significant performance indicators are influential in determining the uptake of CPS for FM, which are operations efficiency, facility adaptation, and client’s satisfaction.

Blockchains have demonstrated impressive and effective applications throughout many aspects of the business. Blockchain technology can lead to the advent of the construction of Digital Twins (DTs). DTs involve the real representation of physical devices digitally as a virtual representation of both elements and dynamics prior to the building and deployment of actual devices. DT products can be built using blockchain-based technology in order to achieve sustainability. The technology of DT is one of the emerging novel technologies of Industry 4.0, along with artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Therefore, the present study adopts intelligent decision-making techniques to con-duct a biased analysis of the drivers, barriers, and risks involved in applying blockchain technologies to the sustainable production of DTs. The proposed model illustrates the use of neutrosophic theory to handle the uncertain conditions of real-life situations and the indeterminate cases evolved in decision-makers’ judgments and perspectives. In addition, the model applies the analysis of Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods through the use of ordered weighted averaging (OWA) and the Technique of Order Preference Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to achieve optimal rankings for DT production providers based on consistent weighted decision-maker’s judgments in order to maintain and to assure sustainability. An empirical study is applied to the uncertain environment to aid decision-makers in achieving ideal decisions for DT providers with respect to various DT challenges, promoting sustainability and determining the best service providers. The Monte Carlo simulation method is used to illustrate, predict, and forecast the importance of the weights of decision-makers' judgments as well as the direct impact on the sustainability of DT production. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI; blockchain technologies; digital twin; industry 4.0; IoT; neutrosophic theory; OWA; sustainability; TOPSIS","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128410939"

This paper presents a system-oriented DT framework with process correlation interaction mechanism that integrates multiple models for dynamic process modeling. The data model is constructed as the core driving model of DT. Based on structural dynamics theory, the weak machine components are taken as digital threads of the data model to correlate position variables and cutting excitation variables. Then, the Frequency Response Function (FRF) corresponding to the principal mode of vibration at the weak machine component is used as an intermediate data for overall online process performance characterization and DT model interaction to enable mirror synchronization of the operation process.

On-site assembly is an uncertain and complex stage in MiC scenario, due to high variability of outside conditions, organization of multi-contractors, and geographic dispersion of activities. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is adopted to support the reengineering of on-site assembly, however, on-site resources couldn't be efficiently and consistently digitalized and the cyber-physical interoperation is fragmented and out-of-date. Digital twin is a key enabler of ICT revolution to address these challenges towards automated and intelligent construction. This paper introduces a digital twin-enabled smart MiC system (DT-SMiCS) with a robotic demonstration for reengineered on-site assembly. On-site resources are converted into Smart MiC Objects (SMiCOs) attaching with UWB and RFID devices to collect and integrate real-time nD data, such as identity, location, cost, and construction progress.

IICE also enables wider adoption of energy-efficient products and Industry 4.0 construction automation through worker-machine interaction pilots. Industry 4.0 and industrialized construction approaches can encourage workforce specialization in energy efficiency construction, address the lack of multi-skilled workers, and increase workforce productivity with construction automation.

Operational modal analysis is an output-only identification tool motivated by the structural identification of civil engineering structures, which are excited by ambient conditions. This technique is increasingly applied in mechanical engineering in order to characterise the system behaviour during operation as modal parameters can vary under operating conditions. The following study investigates the application of operational modal analysis on an axial compressor under operating conditions. Since the modal parameters of the system change depending on the life history and during the operation of the system, a corresponding data analysis might allow us to identify the present status of the system. Eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are studied for the use of structural health monitoring approaches. According to the analysis, eigenfrequencies represent robust parameters for the studied purpose. Eigenvectors are sensitive to damages but need further investigation, especially for rotating machinery. This study will help the user to set up a virtual model, which describes the system behaviour for different boundary conditions. This in turn, will provide an accurate prediction of the vibrational behaviour in order to assure a safe operation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","axial compressor; modal parameters; operational modal analysis; structural health monitoring; turbomachinery","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163938491"

However, the mechanical and deformation characteristics of MPGs are complex, and their practical application is ahead of theoretical research, which greatly limits the popularization and application of MPGs. This paper conducts a series of centrifuge model tests to investigate the mechanical and deformation characteristics and the antislip mechanism of MPGs, then compare them with those of conventional piles (CPs). In particular, MPGs with and without the platform in the strengthening process of the talus slope are compared, and monitoring the reinforcement effect of MPGs subjected to gravity loading. The results suggest that the soil pressure shows a triangular distribution pattern and is influenced by the position of the potential slip zone and the geometry of the bedrock surface. The compatibility deformation of the pile–soil leads to the stress release of the soil behind the pile, which is an important part affecting the anti-slip mechanism of the MPG. The platform limits 75% of the pile top displacement of the MPG and simultaneously redistributes the stress of the piles, providing a better overall antislip effect of the pile–soil composite. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","antislip mechanism; centrifuge modelling test; compatibility deformation; micropile group; pile–soil interaction; talus slope","Centrifuges; Disaster prevention; Soils; Antislip mechanism; Centrifuge model test; Compatibility deformation; Deformation Characteristics; Mechanical characteristics; Micropile group; Micropiles; Pile soil interaction; Pile-soil; Talus slope; Piles; bedrock; centrifugal model test; composite; deformation; performance assessment; pile; talus","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149504015"

In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for connectivity in CPS, which has brought to attention the issue of cybersecurity. Aside from traditional information systems threats, CPS face new challenges due to the heterogeneity of devices and protocols, as well as its strong reliability requirements. In this work, we provide a brief overview of the CPS architecture and applications and describe the security challenges in the three CPS layers of perception, transmission, and application. Besides, we discuss how feature selection (FS) may improve intrusion detection performance. In particular, we evaluate how metaheuristic approaches can improve classification performance in CPS perception, transmission, and application layers.

IoST is expected to serve a wide variety of applications ranging from monitoring and reconnaissance to in-space backhauling, i.e., the network architecture must serve a plethora of application scenarios with differing service-level agreement (SLA) requirements over the same physical infrastructure in an end-to-end manner. At the same time, since the different use cases might belong to a variety of different stakeholders, IoST must support multi-tenancy and functional isolation of services. Consequently, a network slicing framework is vital to the success of IoST. To this end, an automatic network slicing framework for space-ground integrated networks is presented in this paper. The proposed framework has been designed to address the dual objectives of route computation and resource allocation with minimal SLA violations. Different from the existing state-of-the-art, the framework presented herein is purpose-built for ultra-dense CubeSat networks, and is fully automated. In other words, the framework is purely SLA-based, and does not require prior information concerning the resource requirements associated with a slice. Other key innovations introduced through this framework include a robust SLA model for slice customization, a novel topology construction mechanism, and a unique segment routing-based online admission control solution. Furthermore, the flexibility and efficacy of the proposed framework have been evaluated through a comprehensive use case driven evaluation scenario. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CubeSats; Internet of Space Things; network slicing; online optimization; satellite communications; segment routing","Computation theory; Embedded systems; Network architecture; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Topology; Cubesat; Cubesats; Internet of space thing; Network slicing; Online optimization; Online optimization.; Resource management; Routings; Satellite communications; Segment routing; Space vehicles; Satellite communication systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119420329"

A digital twin is defined as the virtual representation of a physical asset that collects and sends real-time information. A digital twin collects data from the physical asset in real-time and uses this data to create a virtual model of the physical object. Its functionality depends on the bi-directional coordination of data between the physical and virtual models. This is likened to cyber-physical systems, which seek to provide bi-directional coordination between the physical and virtual worlds. While digital twins have found applications in the various industrial sectors such as aerospace, manufacturing, and industrial engineering, their applications in the construction industry are relatively limited. Although some level of progress has been made in the construction industry with the application of a digital twin, it still lags in other sectors. Virtual models of constructed facilities are developed and used to plan and construct the actual facility, with changes in the physical facility being automatically reflected in the virtual model based on real-time data and vice-versa. The digital twin shows promising possibilities in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of a facility. This paper reviews the development and implementation of digital twin technology in the construction industry and compares its use with other industries while assessing the benefits of DT to the construction industry. A systematic literature review including a thematic analysis was employed to address the purpose of this study. Limitations associated with the existing and emerging applications are also identified. It concludes by highlighting the importance of DT applications in the construction sector. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bi-directional; Cyber-Physical Systems; Data Analytics; Digital Twin; Real-Time; Virtual Model","Construction industry; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Real time systems; Virtual reality; Bi-directional; Data analytics; Industry sectors; Physical assets; Physical modelling; Physical objects; Real- time; Real-time information; Virtual models; Virtual representations; Data Analytics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129248492"

DT can integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics to create real-time simulation models. These models learn and update from multiple data sources to predict their physical counterparts’ current and future conditions. This has promoted its relevance in various industries, including the construction industry (CI). However, recognising the existence of a distinct set of factors driving its adoption has not been established. Therefore, this study aims to identify the drivers and integrate them into a classification framework to enhance its understanding. Utilising popular databases, including Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect, a systematic literature review of 58 relevant DT adoptions in the CI research was conducted. From the review, the drivers for DT adoption in the CI were identified and classified. The results show that developed countries such as the UK, US, Australia, and Italy have been the top countries in advancing DT adoption in the CI, while developing countries have made commendable contributions. A conceptual framework has been developed to enhance the successful adoption of DT in the CI based on 50 identified drivers. The major categories of the framework include concept-oriented drivers, production-driven drivers, operational success drivers, and preservation-driven drivers. The developed framework serves as a guide to propel DT adoption in the CI. Furthermore, this study contributes to the body of knowledge about DT adoption drivers, which is essential for DT promotion in the CI. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Construction industry; Digital twin; Drivers; Review; Technology","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124043828"

Commonalities between the emerging definitions of digital twins describe them as digital or cyber environments that are bidirectionally-linked to their physical or real-life replica to enable simulation and data-centric decision making. Studies have started to investigate their role in the digitalization of asset delivery, including the management of built assets at different levels within the building and infrastructure sectors. However, questions persist regarding their actual applications and implementation chal-lenges, including their integration with other digital technologies (i.e., building information modeling, virtual and augmented reality, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing). Within the built environment context, this study seeks to analyze the definitions and characteristics of a digital twin, its interactions with other digital technologies used in built asset delivery and operation, and its applications and challenges. To achieve this aim, the research utilizes a thorough literature review and semi-structured interviews with ten industry experts. The literature review explores the merits and the relevance of digital twins relative to existing digital technologies and highlights potential applications and challenges for their implementation. The data from the semi-structured interviews are classified into five themes: definitions and enablers of digital twins, applications and benefits, implementation challenges, existing practical applications, and future development.

These days, many existing urban building energy models (UBEM) use the non-geo-specified 3D building stock geometries or the digital twins of cities as their primary input for energy simulation. The digital twins of cities or the built environment is an accurate scale virtual representation (geo-specified geometry and information) of city objects enabled to be paired with dynamic predictive models of their energy performance. The use of built environment digital twins for their energy assessment works well for those cities whose digital twin datasets are readily available for public or private use. In the cities without digital twin datasets, their energy assessment is limited by tools that use 2D building stock footprints as their primary input or apply a top-down urban energy simulation approach. This gap motivated the current research to identify an extended UBEM data preparation workflow focused on generating city digital twins using accessible GIS datasets as well as national and local data sources. The workflow is majorly developed to deal with GIS data processing utilizing multilevel spatial data integration and refinement to fill in the recognized inconsistencies of building databases. Then, procedural 3D city modelling and an automated transformation to a semantic, CityGML format are successfully provided to generate digital twin of the study area in an open data model. The archetype modelling method is also employed to create a set of customized housing energy profiles to support tailored bottom-up UBEM and retrofitting scenarios relying on the simulation platform Insel4Cities, under development at Concordia University. The workflow was practically carried out on a case study, Kelowna city in British Columbia (BC)/Canada, to validate the district heating load. The average simulated heating energy use intensity showed a deviation of less than 2.5% from the BC measured data. As an example of workflow usability, the developed model was also utilized to assess a retrofit scenario, combining a decentralized heat pump and photovoltaic system, to present the district's potential for net-zero action planning. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Archetype characterization; CityGML; Insel4Cities; UBEM data preparation; Urban Building Energy Modelling (UBEM)","Data integration; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy utilization; Geographic information systems; Housing; Metadata; Open Data; Photovoltaic cells; Retrofitting; Semantics; Simulation platform; Archetype characterization; Building energy model; CityGML; Data preparation; Insel4city; Modeling data; Urban building energy modeling; Urban building energy modeling data preparation; Urban buildings; 3D modeling","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121129302"

During extreme wind events, unsecured objects in jobsites can easily become airborne debris, which results in substantial loss to construction projects and neighboring communities. Towards a systematic disaster preparedness in construction jobsites, this paper presents a novel vision-based digital twinning and threat assessment framework. We encode the context of disaster risk into deep-learning architectures to identify and analyze the characteristics and impacts of potential wind-borne debris in construction site digital twin models. Case studies on nine piles of construction materials are presented to demonstrate and discuss the fidelity of the proposed computational modules.

With more joint applications of both BIM and robotics being exposed, the compatibility of BIM for robotic building construction and maintenance has been found to be fundamentally key to further practical implementations. This paper presents an integrated review combining quantitative and qualitative analyses to clarify the development roadmap of BIM-enabled building automation and robotics. Firstly, information and data management in Digital Twin and robotic building tasks is recapped as the prior knowledge. Secondly, a systematic review on BIM-related research topics in the last 18 years is conducted to demonstrate the inevitability and feasibility of BIM-robot integration, informed by the evolution of lifecycle building information flow. Then, critical analysis on three typical examples of BIM-based robotic construction (i.e. printing, assembling, and welding) are successively performed to reflect the potential BIM-robot integration mechanism and challenges ahead. Finally, a new unified robot-oriented BIM framework, namely BIMfAR, is proposed to conclude the cogitation based on the above analyses. Under the BIMfAR framework, definitions of basic concepts and a practical workflow are discussed to provide guidelines for future applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BIM; BIMfAR framework; Building automation and robotics; Lifecycle information flow; Robotic construction","Construction; Information management; Intelligent buildings; Life cycle; Robotics; Robots; Architecture engineering; BIMfAR framework; Building automation; Building automation and robotic; Building Information Modelling; Information flows; Life-cycle information; Lifecycle information flow; Model robot; Robotic construction; Architectural design","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120966719"

The timeliness, stability, and reliability of them are significantly restricted due to the lack of real-time communication. Therefore, a model framework of intelligent workshop manufacturing system based on a digital twin is proposed in this paper, driving the deep information integration among the physical entity, data collection, and information decision-making. The traditional digital twin of conceptualization and fuzziness needs to be refined, optimized, and upgraded on the basis of the four-dimension collaborative model thinking. The model framework of a refined nine-layer intelligent digital twin is established. Firstly, the physical evaluation is refined into entity layer, auxiliary layer, and interface layer, scientific managing the physical resources and the instrument, and coordinating the overall system. Secondly, dividing the data evaluation into the data layer and the processing layer can greatly improve the flexible response-ability and ensure the synchronization of the real-time data. Finally, the system evaluation is subdivided into information layer, algorithm layer, scheduling layer, and functional layer, developing flexible manufacturing plan more reasonably, shortening the production cycle, and reducing logistics cost. Simultaneously, combining SLP and artificial bee colonies is applied to investigate the production system optimization of the textile workshop. The results indicate that the production efficiency of the optimized production system is increased by 34.46%. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin; Intelligent manufacturing workshop; Production system optimization; Textile production","Manufacture; Scheduling algorithms; Textile industry; Textiles; Advanced manufacturing; Integrated modeling framework; Intelligent Manufacturing; Intelligent manufacturing workshop; Manufacturing industries; Modelling framework; Production system; Production system optimization; System optimizations; Textile production; Decision making","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116796365"

Several researchers in the field of construction are currently designing novel timber structures as well as novel solutions for fabricating such structures, i.e. robot technologies which allow for automation of a domain dominated by skilled craftsman. In this paper, we present a framework for closing the loop between the design and robotic assembly of timber structures. On one hand, we illustrate an extended automation process that incorporates learning by demonstration to learn and execute a complex assembly of an interlocking wooden joint. On the other hand, we describe a design case study that builds upon the specificity of this process, to achieve new designs of construction elements, which were previously only possible to be assembled by skilled craftsmen. The paper provides an overview of a process with different levels of focus, from the integration of a digital twin to timber joint design and the robotic assembly execution, to the development of a flexible robotic setup and novel assembly procedures for dealing with the complexity of the designed timber joints.

Traditional deformation monitoring is conducted once a day through the method of manual measurement. Such monitoring strategy has been blamed for inefficiency and error-prone, and also the monitoring results cannot be timely received by on-site managers for safety management. Therefore, the study proposes a digital twin-driven deformation monitoring system to support accurate risk-preventing decisions. The proposed system comprises four interconnected components for data acquisition, data processing, result visualization, and risk warning, respectively. A real-life tunnelling construction project - Lianghu tunnelling construction in Wuhan, China - is used to illustrate the functionality of the proposed system.

This requires continuous assessment of performance to identify key problems, which allows continuous improvement of construction processes. Novel digital twin approaches form an excellent technological foundation for performance assessment through regular updates with product and process information directly from the construction site. While some publications favour a schema-less approach to digital twins, we argue that well-defined data structures are required to represent complex information reliably and transparently. Existing process and product models are inadequate with respect to the requirements of a digital twin of the construction phase. As a result, we introduce a new process-oriented model that provides an improved basis for advanced process evaluation in the digital twin environment.

Nevertheless, due to the elevated age of many bridges, structural deficiencies are becoming more common. Digital Twins in conjunction with Building Information Modelling (BIM) may significantly support asset management but are only now garnering more attention for infrastructure objects. To ease the transition towards creating digital twins for existing constructions, this work presents a method for automated segmentation of bridge point clouds based on images using convolutional neural networks. For this purpose, semantic segmentation is used for labelling the photographs captured during laser scanning. The classifications masks of this image-based approach are then projected back into 3D, resulting in a labelled point cloud ready for further processing and building component reconstruction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Asset management; Semantic Segmentation; Assets management; Automated segmentation; Building Information Modelling; Convolutional neural network; Cross-domain; Domain matching; Point cloud segmentation; Point-clouds; Road rails; Road tunnel; Convolutional neural networks","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173932728"

This study presents the case of a panelized construction company that has embraced the lean philosophy over the past decade. Experiments undertaken during the process of building a digital twin of the company’s production facility to verify the logic underlying the developed model reveal an increase in productivity. Using the same productivity regression models to model framing operations in two different years, the simulation of combined productive and delay times results in an underestimation compared to actual production data from 2013 but an overestimation compared to actual production data from 2017. Moreover, prominent lean changes implemented over the years that are positively correlated with productivity improvement are identified. These include standardizing the design and manufacturing processes, minimizing waste (including Mura, Muda, and material waste), ensuring a continuous flow, balancing the production line, following a just-in-time approach for the delivery of materials and implementing the 5S program.

A construction digital twin aims to enhance the reality capture of ongoing operations using sensing technologies and AI functions to enable proactive process management. While a digital twin is clearly defined in the context of construction operations, where a digital replica is generated out of a physical site; a design digital twin lacks a clear framing as both twins are digital. This paper explores an approach to creating a design digital twin using agent-based simulation to mimic real BIM-based design projects. Accordingly, a digital replica is generated as an agent-based model. In addition, several KPIs are introduced to capture data related to BIM model dynamics. The results show that the suggested KPIs can increase the transparency of the design process, capture development dynamics at the level of BIM model elements, increase situational awareness among designers related to model development status, and identify higher clashing risk zones. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Design Digital Twin; Lean Construction; Process; Visual Management","Architectural design; Autonomous agents; Construction; Lean production; Construction operations; Design construction; Design digital twin; Design-process; Digital replicas; Exploratory studies; Lean construction; New approaches; Process; Visual management; Computational methods","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170378354"

Buildings have non-stationary and complex dynamics, as the state space to describe their behavior is significantly large and intractable. Existing control approaches are not appropriate to meet the requirements of building automation since they are black-box methodologies which fail to provide a system-level optimal control solution for buildings. They are also static which makes them unable to adapt as the dynamics of the buildings vary. Moreover, model-free approaches are only valid for a specific building and lack the ability to extend to other buildings. This paper offers a Deep Digital Twin approach as a new artificial intelligence structure for building automation platforms. The Deep Digital Twin utilizes a physics-based ontology to provide a self-knowledge of the building operation, and the cause-and-effect interrelation between building subsystems which enables future-forward energy efficient control of the building at the system level. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Construction industry; Intelligent buildings; Black-box methodology; Building automation; Building industry; Complex dynamics; Control approach; Energy; Non-stationary dynamics; Optimality; State-space; System levels; Energy efficiency","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167684992"

Production control from a management perspective often operates at lower levels of information granularity than required at operational levels to perform work without interruptions. If not controlled in detail, causes and effects of workflow interruptions remain unclear in environments of high complexity and non-standardized work. Workflow efficiency has been studied through work sampling or time-motion studies, estimating shares of direct work. However, few studies exist that show how to create digital representations of workflows and analyse them for interruptions, contributing to smoother workflows. The paper examines workflows of plumbing work from video footage. This video data is classified and analysed for frequency, causes, and effects of work interruptions. Results indicate that value-supporting activities caused the largest proportion of interruptions. Moreover, the proportion of non-value-adding activities increases when durations of interruptions rise. Based on the results, the paper contributes to further understanding of workflow interruptions in plumbing work. Finally, it provides suggestions on how to close gaps of information granularity between management and operational levels, through the development of simulation models and the application of automated data collection, contributing to developing digital twins of construction processes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","continuous improvement/kaizen; job-sequencing; production control; time-motion study; workflow","Lean production; Plumbing; Cause and effects; Continuous improvement/kaizen; Continuous improvements; Information granularity; Job sequencing; Motion study; Operational level; Time motions; Time-motion study; Work-flows; Production control","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165705527"

A research on common IoT architecture and maintenance strategies has been carried out besides the theoretical development of a Fault detection diagram on all the typical faults in fan-coil units. A real fan-coil was then inspected to point out its construction details and the points to be monitored. Then it was equipped with the prototype AFDD system. All the components and sensors needed to build the AFDD prototype are commonly available. The design and implementation of automated fault detection and diagnostics (AFDD) for HVAC fan-coils systems fully exploits distributed computing for remote and smart system monitoring, anomaly detection and eventually fault diagnostics to improve maintenance management through the integration of a large number of data locally gathered by smart sensors. Experimental results on the prototype are given about some recurrent fan-coil anomalies. Local intelligence allows a quick and on-site anomaly detection & fault diagnostic, as proven by running the prototype AFDD equipped fan-coil: it could help managing and scheduling maintenance, reducing time-to-fix together with indirect and direct costs, if network connected. Feeding the network with relevant data about the anomalies extracted by the local intelligence allows sharing the information at every level, also in order to statistically rate HAVC components service life and reliability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BIM; Digital twin; Facility management; HVAC; Predictive maintenance","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152641022"

Besides the advancement of artificial intelligence and cutting-edge sensing and actuation systems, allow for traditional recycling procedures to be digitised and become more efficient. Among these, automated sorting machines allow such efficacy, by using multiple recognition technologies to categorise items, instead of relying on humans to separate them. In this sense, this paper presents a new approach being included in the Cyber-Physical Sorting System (CPSS) capable to be adapted in different industries such as urban wastes, construction & demolition wastes as well as mineral sorting. The materials are laid out over a conveyor belt, where multi-purpose visual sensors (hyper-spectral, industrial and short-wave infrared) acquire images in order to classify and sort them in different bins using robotic arms. The architecture of the proposed CPSS allows the integration of additional sensors, increasing the interoperability with upcoming sensing devices. Furthermore, an intelligent hyper-spectral component adapted to urban wastes was developed that classifies glass, metal, paper, and plastic using multi-spectral data in visual and near-infrared ranges between 470nm - 975nm. Scatter-correction methods and derivatives were applied to extract noise-free features, while an exploratory analysis based on simple and robust Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to identify the most significant principal components for the training phase. During the evaluation, the neural network performed better when normalisation and Savtizky and Golay (SG) filtering was applied to the dataset against other classifiers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyber-physical sorting system; Deep learning; Hyper-spectral imaging; Industry 4.0; Machine Learning; Machine Vision; Multi-agent","Belt conveyors; Classification (of information); Cyber Physical System; Deep learning; Demolition; Industry 4.0; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Learning systems; Multi agent systems; Polystyrenes; Principal component analysis; Sorting; Superpixels; Cybe-physical sorting system; Cyber physicals; HyperSpectral; Machine-learning; Machine-vision; Multi agent; Physical sorting; Sorting system; Urban wastes; Computer vision","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152146304"

To be able to develop navigation techniques that make use of these improved capabilities, one must first have a solid grasp of the constraints imposed by each of those different modalities of locomotion. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for evaluating the robots’ locomotion modes. To do this, we formalize the problem as a reinforcement learning task that is applied to a digital twin simulation of the mobile robot. The proposed method is demonstrated through the use of a case study that examines the capabilities of hybrid wheel-on-leg robot locomotion modes in terms of speed, slope ascent, and step obstacle climbing. First, a comprehensive explanation of the process of creating the digital twin of the mobile robot through the use of the Unity gaming engine is presented. Second, a description of the construction of three test environments is provided so that the aforementioned capabilities of the robot can be evaluated. In the end, Reinforcement Learning is used to evaluate the two types of locomotion that the mobile robot can utilize in each of these different environments.

A hybrid modelling approach is utilized, as the establishment of such DTOs either considered on their own or as part of a DT ecosystem is not trivial. Meta modelling and meta model merging patterns are applied to integrate heterogeneous perspectives and domain models. Two main research questions with respect to digitization towards digital twinning are discussed: First, which digitization principles/patterns are appropriate for DTOs? Patterns ranging from ""counting"" to ""estimation"" are introduced to fill digital models serving as a foundation for DTs with data. As a starting point, potential digitization principles for relevant characteristics of BPMN - ""Modelling Method for Business Processes"" and KPI - ""Modelling Method for Key Performance Indicators"" models are considered. Second, which principle/pattern is appropriate for which organizational structure? In order to ease the selection of suitable patterns for specific application scenarios, those will be associated with organizational structures like but not limited to construction processes, assembly processes or production processes each of them with domain-specific characteristics. A prototype consisting of three phases - use case requirements collection, model design and digitization assistance - builds upon (a) physical experimentations in the OMiLAB Innovation Corner using physical assets such as edge devices or sensors, (b) domain specific services considering software related aspects such as timeseries databases or simulation algorithms, and (c) modelling methods enabling the integration of physical and digital components. The paint production pilot from the European Change2Twin project serves as an application scenario evaluation use case. A notion of what the use case company intends to achieve by digital twinning and what is possible by introducing digital services is touched. The outlook presents how artificial intelligence may be introduced for the prototype to leverage the paint production use case and further application scenarios. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Twin of Organization; Digitization Principle/Pattern; Domain Specific Services; Meta Modelling; Physical Experimentations","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146963741"

The inherent complexity of such systems renders the manual construction of simulators an error-prone and costly endeavor, and automation techniques are much sought after. However, current automation techniques are typically tailored to a particular system and cannot be easily transposed to other settings. In this paper, we propose an approach for the automated construction of simulators that can overcome this limitation, based on the inference of Discrete Event System Specifications (DEVS) models by reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning allows inferring knowledge on the construction process of the simulator, instead of inferring the simulator itself. This, in turn, fosters reuse across different systems. DEVS further improves the reusability of this knowledge, as the vast majority of simulation formalisms can be efficiently translated to DEVS. We demonstrate the performance and generalizability of our approach on an illustrative example implemented in Python and Tensorforce. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","automation; DEVS; machine learning; reinforcement learning","Discrete event simulation; Embedded systems; Reinforcement learning; Reusability; Specifications; Automation techniques; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Discrete-Event System Specification; Learning problem; Machine-learning; Model construction; Reinforcement learnings; Software intensive systems; Specification models; Automation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146951323"

Since PQoE models are user-specific and time-varying, existing schemes based on universal and time-invariant PQoE models may suffer from performance degradation. To address this issue, we first propose a DT-assisted PQoE model construction method to obtain accurate user-specific PQoE models. Specifically, user DTs (UDTs) are respectively constructed for individual users, which can acquire and utilize users' data to accurately tune PQoE model parameters in real time. Next, given the obtained PQoE models, we formulate a resource management problem to maximize the overall long-term PQoE by taking the dynamics of users' locations, video requests, and buffer statuses into account. To solve this problem, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is developed to jointly determine segment version selection, and communication and computing resource allocation. Simulation results on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively enhance PQoE compared with benchmark schemes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Deep learning; Quality of service; Reinforcement learning; Video streaming; Adaptive video streaming; Construction method; Model construction; Modeling parameters; Performance degradation; Real- time; Resource management problems; Time invariants; Time varying; User data; Resource allocation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146938959"

Not only the formally recognized CH assets but also the non-CH structures and infrastructure, and the interconnection between them are crucial to be considered in a vulnerability assessment tool for the sustainable reconstruction of historic areas. Since most CH assets were not designed based on robust design codes to resist natural hazards such as earthquakes, vulnerability assessment and preservation are pivotal tasks for the authorities. For this aim, Hyperion, an H2020 project (Grant agreement No 821054), was formed in order to take advantage of existing tools and services together with novel technologies to deliver an integrated vulnerability assessment platform for improving the resiliency of historic areas. Geometric documentation is the first and most important step toward the generation of digital twins of CH assets that can be facilitated using 3D laser scanners or drone imaging. Afterward, the finite element method is an accurate approach for developing the simulation-based digital twins of cultural heritage assets. For calibration of the models, the result of the operational modal analysis from the ambient vibration testing using accelerometers can be utilized. Structural analysis for the prediction of the structural behavior or near real-time analysis can be carried out on the calibrated models.

Because wireless communication is used for various purposes in offices, this technology has become a basic infrastructure for business. Therefore, when building a new office or renovating an office, verifying the impact on radio waves while designing the workspace is paramount. However, no highly accurate simulation tools for radio waves are available that can be easily used by office planners, who do not possess expert knowledge of radio waves. To address this challenge, we propose smart office planning system that can be linked to a radio wave emulation system that can verify radio wave propagation and communication behavior with high accuracy and can be easily used by office planners. This paper presents the results of a usability evaluation of a smart office planning system. As a result, users could easily set simulation scenario by preparing a general-purpose template option and could evaluate the state of wireless communication by using 2 visualization strategies: A three-dimensional visualization that simultaneously presents the three-dimensional structure of the office space, radio propagation, and communication behavior, and a two-dimensional visualization that visualizes problems affecting the quality of work. Moreover, in the future, by integrating the smart office planning system with the radio wave emulation system, office planners will presumably be able to verify the effects of workspace design on radio waves in advance, thereby reducing the man-hours required for office construction and ensuring adequate communication quality in the workspace. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyber-physical system; Radio visualization; Radio wave propagation; Smart office design; Wireless Emulator","Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Office buildings; Quality control; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; Wave propagation; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Office design; Planning systems; Radio visualization; Radiowaves propagation; Smart office design; Smart offices; Wireless communications; Wireless emulator; Radio waves","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145663333"

In this paper, we present a privacy threat analysis on the general architecture of connected and autonomous vehicles, to point out privacy risks according to formal privacy requirements. We present a use case modularization and its analysis that helps us to discern the privacy requirements of this use case, which can be enabled by manufacturers. To meet the previous objectives, we follow a LINDDUN methodology of privacy threat analysis. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autonomous Vehicle; Connected; Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS); Privacy; Privacy engineering framework; Security; Threat Analysis","Cyber Physical System; Cybersecurity; Data privacy; Embedded systems; Modular construction; Risk assessment; Autonomous Vehicles; Connected; Cybe-physical system; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Engineering frameworks; Privacy; Privacy engineering framework; Privacy engineerings; Security; Threats analysis; Autonomous vehicles","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144816882"

The formal method of supervisor synthesis allows engineers to obtain a correct-by-construction supervisor from a model of the plant and a model of the requirements. Validation, however, remains an important step in this design process. Model simulation is often used as a first validation method, but this lacks aspects related to the execution of the supervisor such as the operating semantics and interfaces with external subsystems. To incorporate these aspects, hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation is used. This paper describes the process of deriving an implementable controller from a synthesized supervisor, implementing it in a HIL setup, and validating it using HIL tests. Specifically, the paper focuses on the design of resource controllers, a relaxation in the confluence check for implementable controllers, and the process of automatically generating and optimizing PLC code. Furthermore, a real-life case study is presented in which a supervisory controller is derived and implemented for the Swalmen tunnel. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Event-based control; Hardware-in-the-loop simulation; Model validation; Supervision and testing; Supervisory control and automata","Controllers; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Formal methods; Process control; Semantics; Supervisory personnel; Synthetic apertures; Traction (friction); Cyber-physical systems; Event-based control; Hardware-in-the-loop testing; Hardwarein-the-loop simulations (HIL); Model validation; Road tunnel; Supervision and testing; Supervisory control; Supervisory control and automaton; Supervisory controllers; Hardware-in-the-loop simulation","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144436580"

Supervisory control theory (SCT) is a formal control method that provides correct-by-construction safety certificates, but is computationally inefficient when the number of system components is large. On the other hand, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides a toolbox of efficient algorithms to compute control decisions even for very large state space, but does not always guarantee safety. In this paper, we propose to synergize SCT and DRL into a new efficient safe control approach. Specifically, we first employ DRL algorithms to efficiently compute sub-optimal solutions which may be unsafe; then we convert the obtained solutions into a standard supervisory control problem with an automaton (plant model) and a set of unsafe states (safety specification); finally we use SCT to synthesize a supervisor with a safety certificate. A case study of multi-robot warehouse logistic automation is conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of this proposed approach. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Reinforcement Learning; Safe Control; Supervisory Control","Control theory; Deep learning; Embedded systems; Industrial robots; Multipurpose robots; Safety engineering; Warehouses; Case-studies; Deep reinforcement learning; ITS applications; Multirobots; Reinforcement learning control; Reinforcement learnings; Safe control; Supervisory control; Supervisory control theory; Warehouse automation; Reinforcement learning","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144367560"

Meanwhile, other sectors (like manufacturing) adopted Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve complex, non-linear problems to reduce waste, inefficiency, and pollution. Therefore, many research efforts in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction community have recently tried introducing AI into building asset management (AM) processes. Since AM encompasses a broad set of disciplines, an overview of several AI applications, current research gaps, and trends is needed. In this context, this study conducted the first state-of-the-art research on AI for building asset management. A total of 578 papers were analyzed with bibliometric tools to identify prominent institutions, topics, and journals. The quantitative analysis helped determine the most researched areas of AM and which AI techniques are applied. The areas were furtherly investigated by reading in-depth the 83 most relevant studies selected by screening the articles' abstracts identified in the bibliometric analysis. The results reveal many applications for Energy Management, Condition assessment, Risk management, and Project management areas. Finally, the literature review identified three main trends that can be a reference point for future studies made by practitioners or researchers: Digital Twin, Generative Adversarial Networks (with synthetic images) for data augmentation, and Deep Reinforcement Learning. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Asset Management; Computer Vision; Machine Learning; Neural Network","Climate change; Computer vision; Deep learning; Project management; Risk assessment; Risk management; Sustainable development; Architecture community; Architecture engineering; Assets management; Built environment; Greenhouse emissions; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Nonlinear problems; Present status; Research efforts; Asset management","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144309918"

While this digital revolution has helped the construction industry to prevent cost and time overruns and enable efficiency and good work's quality, it also has disadvantages and risks such as cyberattacks and loss of jobs. This study set out to determine the risks associated with data management (cyberattacks) on construction projects in the fourth industrial revolution era. The research study will address the questions of “what are the cyberattacks risk attributed to construction data management in the fourth revolution era?” and “What are the differences in the opinion of respondents concerning the identified cyberattacks?”. This research work used a quantitative method and gathered information from different construction professionals in the South African construction industry precisely in Gauteng province via a well-structured questionnaire through online platforms. These professionals involve quantity surveyors, architects, civil, mechanical, and electrical engineers practising under a firm, company, organisation, or institution within the Gauteng province, South Africa. Findings revealed that viruses, hacking, and password cracking are the most frequent risk to data management encountered in the construction industry. It was also indicated that construction project stakeholders need a strong knowledge of how attackers operate to address, avoid, and stop the different risks rising when executing a project. The study contributes to the body of knowledge by highlighting the various risks encountered in managing data in the construction industry which will assist professionals in the industry to pay attention to means of mitigating the identified risks. This will keep stakeholders abreast of how simple negligence from their side can deeply affect the project data thereby affecting project delivery. It was concluded based on findings that construction professionals need to avoid the occurrence of these risks to enhance satisfactory project delivery and protect their project information. The study recommended that all construction project parties require full training sessions on risks to data to prevent any types of intrusion into the company's information system. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","construction industry; data management; data risks; fourth industrial revolution","Construction; Construction industry; Embedded systems; Network security; Personal computing; Project management; Viruses; Construction data; Construction professionals; Construction projects; Cyber-attacks; Data risk; Digital revolution; Fourth industrial revolution; Industrial revolutions; Project delivery; South Africa; Information management","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144286733"

Despite its prevalence, this connector has exhibited remarkable drawbacks, prominently the shear failure at the bottom of the shank. In this research, three novel coconut palm stem (CPS) shaped studs are proposed for composite constructions, aiming to improve the shear capacity and slip performance of the connection. The traditional circular headed stud (CHS) geometry has been restructured to a proposed CPS-shaped stud while maintaining total steel materi al volume to be the same. Pushout tests were experimentally performed on CHS and CPS-shaped shear connectors to investigate their performance evaluation for ultimate strength, stiffness, ductility, and failure mode. Moreover, the Abaqus/Explicit has been e mployed to model a pushout specimen. A proposed finite element model was successfully validated with the test results for further parametric analysis. Two distinct grades of concrete and three CPS shapes were considered for the parametric investigation. Fi nally, three formulas were developed and proposed to predict the shear capacity of the CPS-shaped stud. The performance of the CHS and CPS-shaped stud connections was compared, revealing that the proposed CPS-shaped studs offer 37 to 47% higher shear strength, double stiffness, and slip with better ductility. So, CPS-shaped stud may substitute the traditional headed stud shear connectors in steel-concrete composite structures with added strength, stiffness, and ductility. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abaqus; Composite structures; Concrete slab-steel beam; CPS-shaped stud; Headed stud shear connectors; Pushout test","Composite structures; Ductility; Steel beams and girders; Stiffness; Structure (composition); Studs (fasteners); Studs (structural members); Abaqus; Coconut palm stem-shaped stud; Composites structures; Concrete slab-steel beam; Headed stud; Headed stud shear connectors; Palm stems; Performances evaluation; Push-out tests; Steel beams; Concrete slabs","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143506747"

Public procurement particularly suffers of poor digitalization with ineffective processes and low adoption of Green Public Procurement (GPP) mainly due to the lack of digital and automated data-driven tools for tender evaluation. Leveraging DTs as virtual Prototypes (DTPs) could help to overcome the current discrete project performances evaluation and enable a systemic one, exploitable for bids evaluation besides performance and sustainability optimization. The research adopts a PLM view to define a methodology aimed at developing DTPs starting from the bidding BIM models. The main objective is to integrate several DTPs and an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system in the aim automatizing MEAT (Most Economic Advantageous Tender) procedure and promote GPP adoption, providing an optimal and more objective data-driven awarding system and criteria weighting. Three crucial objectives should be accomplished: (i) the definition of a replicable methodology to develop the DTPs, (ii) the definition of their informative structure and (iii) the re-engineering of tender processes to bring full digitalization and automation. This could enable more effective decisions and performance optimization, bids objective evaluation, tendering procedure streamlining, transparency and sustainability enhancement. The awarded DTP, as a truthful “As-built” developed accordingly to defined information guidelines, must be exploited as the basis for valuable DTIs to manage the whole lifecycle, optimizing DTs development costs together with operational and maintenance costs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Twin Prototype; Green Public Procurement; PLM; Tender evaluation; Waste Management","Architectural design; Bridges; Decision making; Information management; Life cycle; Sustainable development; Architectural engineering constructions; Data driven; Decision-making process; Digital twin prototype; Engineering operation; Green public procurement; Process management; Product life cycle management; Public procurement; Tender evaluation; Waste management","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143413486"

As a result, it was found that the expression of the architectural space, the safety of the construction, and the accuracy of the estimation were improved.

Digital Twins (DT) can support solving some of these problems, mainly when associated with lean principles. However, there are still many gaps in the literature regarding the state of practice of DT for construction. This study investigates how current research on the integrated use of BIM-based DT and lean for construction projects has been positioned in front of practical challenges, aiming to identify research directions that support future applications in the construction phase. The research method adopted was a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). A total of 14 publications were identified and analyzed from the perspective of challenges for practical applications, considering seven aspects regarding DT application in other industries: cognitive and technical level of people, technology and infrastructure, support tools, standards, and specifications, cost control and management, cyber security and intellectual property rights, and insufficient development of DT. The results suggest that the challenges for DT implementation may become more complex due to the dynamic and unique nature of the construction site and that there is still a large field for further research on DT with lean. Finally, some future research directions are proposed. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BIM; Digital Twins; Integration; Lean Construction; Production Planning and Control","Architectural design; Intellectual property; Laws and legislation; Lean production; Production control; Project management; 'current; BIM; Construction projects; Information flows; Integrated use; Lean construction; Lean principles; Production planning and control; Quality costs; State of practise; Construction industry","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142724643"

Although a typical system requires object detection to prevent collisions with obstacles in the workspace, practical safety performance relies heavily on detection accuracy and processing time delays. To achieve both robustness and operational efficiency while increasing safety, we propose a system that determines the possibility of a collision from the observed point cloud and the posture of an excavator without detecting objects. This is achieved by introducing an excavator model synchronized with a real one as a digital twin and evaluating the overlap between the volume occupied by the model and the point cloud observed by the 3D LiDAR sensor. Moreover, the algorithm to estimate the position and orientation of the 3D LiDAR was developed utilizing a digital twin and the probabilistic sequential estimation technique. The proposed system was successfully demonstrated through experiments using a real excavator, making us confident that deploying the system, from the installation of LiDAR to normal operation, could be fully automated. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Automation; Collision avoidance; Construction equipment; Excavation; Excavators; Object detection; Optical radar; Safety devices; Autonomous excavators; Collision avoidance systems; Construction automation; Detection sensors; Light detection and ranging; Objects detection; Point-clouds; Ranging sensors; Real- time; Sensor calibration; Calibration","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141660516"

By utilizing the AAS, use cases can be implemented with high interoperability. These use cases include optimizations and improvements of physical systems, like predictive maintenance or other artificial intelligence applications. For these use cases, historical data is key. However, there exists no guidance on how to handle historical data with the AAS. Furthermore, no integrated architecture exists that enables seamless storage and retrieval of historical data using the unified AAS meta-model and interface. Thus, we bridge this gap between use case and unified implementation by presenting multiple blueprints for data storage and retrieval motivated by use cases from Industry 4.0, healthcare, and civil construction. These data storage blueprints range from a mandatory change in the AAS infrastructure to augmentations of the existing AAS concepts. Furthermore, we showcase how the data model of the AAS can be utilized for a unified retrieval of historical data.

The article analyzed the data structure of the blockchain and completed the construction of the platform operation mode. It studied the encryption and decryption process of cryptography and expanded the ciphertext space, then the blockchain is encrypted and decrypted again, and finally, a chi-square analysis is performed. After building the platform, it conducted market research and analyzed the main operating indicators of the A platform on the market. Then, it compared the uncertain string preprocessing enumeration length change and the index occupied space between the platform constructed in this paper and the platform in the literature. The comparison results have shown that the index proposed in this paper is 320 MB in 8 iterative calculations, while the bibliographic index starts at 10000 MB and keeps increasing during the iterative calculation process. The two are not in the same order of magnitude, illustrating the superiority of the platform in this paper. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Commerce; Cryptography; Iterative methods; Market Research; Network security; Block-chain; Decentralisation; Development and applications; Digital assets; Digital life; Form factors; Interactive platform; Internet technology; Iterative calculation; Standard protocols; Blockchain","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140832235"

Semantic web technologies promise to reduce data interoperability issues. However, methods to discover occupants’ experiences and integrate those with linked building data are scarce. This paper aims to show how combining knowledge discovery in databases and semantic web technology could lead to an improved understanding of occupants’ experiences in buildings. This approach is applied to a case study using the Open Family Home. An occupant collected feedback on various comfort indicators using a smartwatch app. Building information, sensor data, weather data, and occupant information and feedback were integrated into a cross-domain semantic digital twin. A Python script collected all the data from the digital twin and ran a data analysis, after which parameters that affected the occupant’s experience were collected. The results were transformed into triples and integrated with the linked building data. This combination of knowledge discovery in databases and semantic web technologies results in enriched digital twins that can be used for occupant-centric decision-making.

The unique feature: customer, switchgear manufacturers, and their suppliers work with the same model. The device manufacturers supply macros in which all the properties of their products are mapped. The electrical designers insert these devices into their schematic and thus generate a logical version of the model. The layout planner then puts the model into physical form by arranging the devices in the virtual switchgear cabinet.

Technologies associated with I4.0 were born out of the ever-present necessity of automation (and integration) on the shop floor, as well as of better management in product lifecycle with computer-aided software. Although indeed relevant outside Manufacturing, it is yet not clear how to transpose and apply some I4.0 technologies - for instance, Digital Twins (DTs) - outside the context of a factory or of complex, one-of-a-kind products. Many researchers and software companies from Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) and Facilities Management (FM) sectors are already working with an ill-defined concept of a DT, and some difficulties had arisen in dissociating it from Building Information Modeling (BIM). Without a direct counterpart outside AEC/FM, the practice of BIM could be likened to Product Lifecycle Management (PLM). Aiming at creating a clearer picture of where, when, and what should be a DT on AEC/FM, through literature review, clustering of common terms found, and a conceptual engineering approach, the present work develops a concept of DT, and layout differences between it and BIM model. It is advocated that DTs should be more about ""functional models"" for simulations than ""product models"" for information visualization and organization. As a result, DTs could be used to predict ""behavior"", and thus enhance and transform management, operations, and maintenance practices. In doing so, there is yet a set of challenges that need to be addressed before one could create and employ properly Digital Twins in Construction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BIM; Digital Twin; Industry 4.0; Simulation","Architectural design; Information systems; Life cycle; Robotics; Architecture engineering; Building Information Modelling; Computer-aided; Conceptual engineering; Facilities management; One of a kind; Product life cycles; Shopfloors; Simulation; Software company; Industry 4.0","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137123927"

However, the silo nature of the organisational operations and proprietary constraints of AMIS have created challenges to the system's interoperability and asset information sharing. Recognised as a key driver behind digital transformation in the industry, BIM has the potential to provide a holistic solution to system integration and fundamentally change the current asset management practices. Based on a treepillared framework observed in the existing studies, where the three key aspects, i.e., business models, operational processes, and end-user experience are used as a development roadmap, this study creates a BIM-based digital platform, namely the Asset Management Common Data Environment (AMCDE) model that can integrate multiple systems to improve AM process interoperability and data sharing. Using a case study of a BIM implementation project carried out by a local government in New Zealand, this study demonstrates the development and validation of the AMCDE model.

While significant progress is being made in construction digitalisation, geometric QC processes remain highly manual and inefficient. This manuscript proposes a new methodology to pre-process initial information contained in the as-designed Building Information Model ('BIM model' hereafter) and obtain a full list of the geometric QC tasks that need to be conducted over the duration of the corresponding construction project. The proposed methodology employ a network graph constructed automatically from the BIM model information; a dictionary of types of geometric QC (e.g. dimensions to be checked with tolerances) that apply to the given project ; and a QC digital manager that ties both elements together and identifies the list of unique geometric QC tasks that need to be conducted throughout the given project. The workings of the proposed methodology are illustrated with a case study, for some QC specifications extracted from the EN 13670 standard. These demonstrate its usefulness to exhaustively establish and record all geometric QC tasks required over a project. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BIM; Digital Twin; Geometric; IFC; Point Clouds; Quality Control","Architectural design; Geometry; Information theory; Quality assurance; Robotics; BIM; Building Information Modelling; Construction projects; Control process; Control task; Geometric; Geometric quality; IFC; Point-clouds; Pre-processing; Quality control","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137095333"

In the DT concept, cyber-physical system theory is utilized to collect condition data about an existing asset and then integrate this data into the digital model. The major limitation though is that the current scope of DT is limited to the operation and maintenance phase. Nevertheless, the DT concept can be extended to the entire lifecycle of the asset if the relevant sensory and non-sensory data are incorporated into the digital model in an automated and systematic way. However, in the current literature, there is no clear insight about such a holistic and life-cycle DT concept for infrastructure projects. Especially, there is very little understanding about how various sensory and non-sensory data from construction and operation phases can be seamlessly integrated into the 3D BIM models. Therefore, this research aims to develop a conceptual model for the architecture of Lifecycle DT (LDT) focusing on bridges. To this end, an ontological modeling approach is adopted. The proposed ontology is validated through a workshop session where domain experts assessed the results with respect to some competency questions. The outcome of the session indicated that the proposed ontology scored sufficiently in all the criteria and succeeded in satisfying the information needs of the LDT. Overall, the proposed model offers an insight into a lifecycle modeling practice as well as automated data incorporation, enabling a smooth transition towards an upgraded modeling practice. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bridge information modelling; Digital twin; Lifecycle digital twin; Ontological modelling","Architectural design; Bridges; Embedded systems; Information theory; Ontology; Robotics; 'current; Bridge information modeling; Building Information Modelling; Conceptual model; Digital modeling; Information Modeling; Lifecycle digital twin; Ontological modeling; Ontology's; Sensory data; Life cycle","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137087198"

The connection enables an information construct understood for its use within the Digital Twin of the building during construction phases. The pipeline requires a comprehensive coordination between stakeholders at both the site (Construction) and the structural control office, which is challenging. The pipeline consists of a) temperature sensors, b) a mobile app connected to the sensor via Bluetooth with basic instructions for datagatherers, c) integration and interoperability of BIM, and, d) an advanced Finite Element (FE) model. By measuring the concrete temperature during many days, realistic concrete mechanical properties are inferred and infused into the FE models using adequate calibration.

By combining the real and digital worlds, digital technologies, such as Digital Twin, provide a high-level depiction of bridges and their assets. The inspection, evaluation, and management of infrastructure have experienced profound changes in technological advancement over the last decade. Technologies like laser scanners have emerged as a viable replacement for labor-intensive, costly, and dangerous traditional methods that risk health and safety. The new maintenance techniques have increased their use in the construction section, particularly regarding bridges. This review paper aims to present a comprehensive and state-of-the-art review upon using laser scanners in bridge maintenance and engineering and looking deeper into the study field in focus and researchers' suggestions in this field. Moreover, the review was conducted to gather, evaluate, and analyze the papers collected in the years from 2017 to 2022. The interaction of research networks, dominant subfields, the co-occurrence of keywords, and countries were all examined. Four main categories were presented, namely machine learning, bridge management system (BMS), bridge information modeling (BrIM), and 3D modeling. The findings demonstrate that information standardization is the first significant obstacle to be addressed before the construction sector can benefit from the usage of Digital Twin. As a result, this article proposes a conceptual framework for building management using Digital Twins as a starting point for future research. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135059036"

However, researcher considered more requirements from product manufacturing/assemble stage, and less requirements from product operation stage. Identifying subsystems to be improved and risk analysis is two methods applied to product design considering the effect of failure at product operation stage. But these methods are labor-intensive and time-consuming tasks and need a lot of expert knowledge. There are huge amounts of data including inspection reports and maintenance records in product operation stage. These data can offer meaningful feedback on next-generation product design. The past few years, digital twin has gained considerable attention because it is characterized by two-way interactions between the digital and physical worlds. This paper proposes a digital twin (DT) framework for product to-be-designed analysis based on operation data. DT data is collected and store from the operation stage of current product. DT data is processed and analyzed to acquire the operation knowledge by Clustering algorithm, Frequent Pattern-growth algorithm, Multi-attribute decision-making, etc. The failure knowledge is used for the design of next-generation product. It can help designer to identify subsystems to be improved and offer the failure information for risk analysis. The failure knowledge also predicts the easily failure subsystems at operation stage of current product. A case of Tunnel Boring Machine is given to illustrate the implementation process of the framework and realize the part function of the framework. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","failure mode analysis; product iteration; service data; Shown digital twin","Clustering algorithms; Construction equipment; Decision making; Failure (mechanical); Life cycle; Product design; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; 'current; Failure Knowledge; Failure mode analysis; Labor time; Operation stages; Product iteration; Product manufacturing; Product operations; Service data; Shown digital twin; Iterative methods","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133504417"

The construction industry is increasingly creating valuable digital assets, but it is also gradually using digital technology to plan, design, build, monitor, and control the physical ones. This makes construction sites and operations vulnerable to cyber-attacks. While the damage to digital assets can have financial implications, attacks on digitally-controlled physical assets may impact people's well-being and, in worst-case scenarios, result in casualties. The problem is amplified by the emerging cyber-physical nature of the systems, where the human checks may be left out. The construction industry could draw inspiration from the work done in critical infrastructures (CI). Construction is the prelude of any socio-technical asset tagged as a CI. While most assets may not be critical in the CI sense, they are essential to a business' operations and the people directly or indirectly associated with them. This study presents a literature review on the previous CI protection (CIP) efforts and construction cybersecurity studies to show their synergy. Recommendations based on well-established CIP processes to make construction more cyber-secure are provided. It is expected that this study will create awareness about cybersecurity practices within the construction industry. Ongoing work includes understanding where construction stands and developing a framework to address cybersecurity throughout the different project phases. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Construction 4.0; Critical Infrastructure; Cyber Security; Cyber-physical Systems; Digitalization; EPCIP","Construction industry; Critical infrastructures; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Network security; Public works; Construction 4.0; Critical infrastructure protection; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber security; Cyber-physical systems; Design control; Digital assets; Digital technologies; Digitalization; EPCIP; Cybersecurity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133446321"

While the benefits of such transformation in construction are apparent, cybersecurity aspects are usually overlooked. Cyber-attacks against project information can cause the exposure of confidential project data, intellectual property, and personal information and interruption of project tasks. On the other hand, cybersecurity incidents affecting the OT utilized in the project can lead to misinformation, harm people nearby, or even cause loss of life. Given the criticality of providing robust cybersecurity in construction projects, this study aims to (1) point out the cybersecurity considerations to be taken into account before utilizing autonomous equipment on-site, (2) raise awareness about cybersecurity in construction, and (3) present an example of using vulnerability assessment systems in construction projects. This paper utilizes the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) to assess the vulnerabilities and risks of different levels of an autonomous site monitoring system. Four assessors with different backgrounds in cybersecurity and robotic systems performed the assessment. The results revealed the most vulnerable levels of the assessed robotic system, which can be considered as a warning. The assessment suggested in this study can help construction decision-makers identify the levels they need to pay extra attention to before employing a cyber-physical system (CPS) on-site.

This is especially helpful in the prefabrication in timber construction, as components and requirements vary widely between projects. However, reconfigurations must be quick to keep downtimes short. The planning of reconfigurations is a complex problem where digital twins and simulation models of the manufacturing systems are necessary for simulation and validation. In our timber prefabrication use case, building components and requirements change from project to project, and the manufacturing system needs to reconfigure frequently. The building components and the configuration of the manufacturing system are designed simultaneously during a co-design process to ensure the integrity of the manufacturing process in a changing manufacturing environment. Hence, this may require many iterations of the planning process. Each iteration needs validation through a simulation. However, the manual generation of simulation models is time-consuming and error-prone and thus poses an obstacle for the digital planning phase. This paper addresses this issue and presents a model-based approach to generate simulation models for reconfigurable manufacturing systems. Our system and its components are modeled in automation markup language as this domain-specific language allows us to model not only kinematics and geometry but also behavior, skills, and interfaces to check the compatibility of components. We apply the method to our use case with the IntCDC wood prefabrication system. The proposed method builds a component graph for a configuration of the manufacturing system and generates the required packages for the simulation in Gazebo and ROS. To build simulation models automatically, we apply model-to-model and model-to-text transformation techniques. The proposed method is suitable for integration in the digital co-design workflow of IntCDC and allows fast iterations with continuous simulations of machine configurations throughout the planning process. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AutomationML; IntCDC; Reconfigurable Manufacturing System; ROS; Simulation; Software Defined Manufacturing; Timber Prefabrication; URDF","Computer software; Iterative methods; Life cycle; Manufacture; Problem oriented languages; AutomationML; IntCDC; Reconfigurable manufacturing system; ROS; Simulation; Simulation model; Software defined manufacturing; Timber construction; Timber prefabrication; URDF; Timber","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132255436"

BIM is an innovative modeling method that proposes a substantial change in the entire workflow of a project aimed at the digitization of information processes and supported by the transition from 2D to 3D design. The Digital Twin, final product of the entire design process, represents a valuable tool to support the management of the building but, at present, its potential is not fully exploited. Today, the market offers many solutions for building and facility management, but in none of them the information is well contextualized within the space. SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) systems, in fact, applied to the building and plant field, do not offer a representation of the building that has a decisive impact on the final user experience. The objective of this discussion is, therefore, to propose an innovative system that exploits the unexpressed potential of BIM and extends the usefulness of the project beyond the construction of the building. The ability of BIM to produce a Digital Twin suggests the possibility of integrating this model within the SCADA system.

To deal with these existing issues, we propose a decentralized, efficient, and privacy-enhanced federated edge learning system called DEEP-FEL, which enables medical devices in different institutions to collaboratively train a global model without raw data mutual exchange. Firstly, we design a hierarchical ring topology to alleviate centralization of the conventional training framework, and formulate the ring construction as an optimization problem, which can be solved by an efficient heuristic algorithm. Subsequently, we design an efficient parameter aggregation algorithm for distributed medical institutions to generate a new global model, and the total amount of data transmitted by N nodes is only 2/N times that of traditional algorithm. In addition, data security among different medical institutions is enhanced by adding artificial noise to the edge model. Finally, experimental results on three medical datasets demonstrate the superiority of our system. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyber physical systems; decentralized system; differential privacy; federated learning; mobile healthcare","Blockchain; Data privacy; Decentralized systems; Diagnosis; Embedded systems; Heuristic algorithms; Hospital data processing; Internet of things; mHealth; Peer to peer networks; Remote patient monitoring; Topology; Collaborative Work; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Decentralised; Decentralized system; Differential privacies; Federated learning; Medical services; Mobile handsets; Peer-to-peer computing; Cyber Physical System","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130436965"

The aim of our work is to propose a correct-by-construction formal approach, based on the refinement technique of the Event-B method, to model and verify such systems.

In the context of civil and infrastructure domains, the term ""digital twin"" has been redefined as up-to-date digital representations of built environments. This paper proposes a real-time participatory sensing-driven computational framework to model the up-to-date state of built environments in a virtual environment. In the proposed framework, crowdsourced visual data are obtained from citizens' participation to automatically identify the up-to-date states of infrastructure that would negatively impact the community resilience in extreme weather conditions. Then, to update the associated built environment information, real-time participatory sensing data are processed by using deep learning algorithms. Finally, the identified geometric and geospatial information of infrastructure is fed into the virtual environment toward a digital twin city model. Case studies in the context of power distribution infrastructure systems were conducted in Houston, TX, and it was demonstrated that the proposed method robustly updates the up-to-date condition of infrastructure into the digital twin city model. The proposed approach for updating virtual models based on participatory sensing-based real-time information has a great potential to facilitate data-driven decision-making for urban planning and infrastructure management in a smart city digital twin. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Data Analytics; Decision making; Deep learning; Smart city; Virtual reality; Built environment; City model; Computational framework; Digital representations; Manufacturing management; Participatory Sensing; Product management; Real- time; Real-world; Visual data; Human computer interaction","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128979097"

Through an iterative learning cycle via discussions among the various project stakeholders, the case study led to uncovering the roadblocks in practice faced by the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) practitioners. This research finds that the practitioners are facing difficulty in (1) creating a shared understanding among the participants due to the lack of consensus on the Digital Twin concept, (2) adapting and investing in Digital Twin due to inability to exhaustively evaluate and select the appropriate technological capabilities in a Digital Twin, and (3) allocation of resources for Digital Twin development due to the inability to assess the impact of DT on the organizational conditions and processes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Action research; Case-studies; Highway maintenance; Iterative learning; Learning cycle; Maintenance projects; Project participants; Project stakeholders; Research studies; Stumbling blocks; Software design","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128960444"

This paper outlines the concept for a Digital Twin for Construction Safety (DTCS), defining three essential steps in the digital twin workflow: (1) safe design and planning for hazard prevention, (2) risk monitoring and control for proactive prediction and warning, and (3) continuous performance improvement for personalized- or project-based learning. DTCS should be viewed as a system-based approach enhancing the overall safety performance rather than exclusively integrating sensing information or safety knowledge in Building Information Modeling (BIM) for safety purposes.

A remarkable progress has been made in scaling the scope of applicability of correct-by-construction synthesis – with a focus on cyber-physical systems that tie discrete-event control with continuous environment – to enlarge control systems by combining symbolic approaches with principled state-space reduction techniques. Unfortunately, in the security-critical control systems, the security properties are verified ex post facto the design process in a way that undermines the correct-by-construction paradigm. We posit that, to truly realize the dream of correct-by-construction synthesis for security-critical systems, security considerations must take center-stage with the safety considerations. Moreover, catalyzed by the recent progress on the opacity sub-classes of security properties and the notion of hyperproperties capable of combining security with safety properties, we believe that the time is ripe for the research community to holistically target the challenge of secure-by-construction synthesis. This paper details our vision by highlighting the recent progress and open challenges that may serve as bricks for providing a solid foundation for secure-by-construction synthesis of cyber-physical systems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Correct-by-construction synthesis; Cyber-physical systems; Opacity; Secure-by-construction synthesis","Control system synthesis; Cyber Physical System; Cybersecurity; Discrete event simulation; Formal methods; Opacity; Safety engineering; Construction methodology; Correct-by-construction; Correct-by-construction synthesis; Formal proofs; Recent progress; Safety critical systems; Scalings; Secure-by-construction synthesis; Security properties; Security-critical; Embedded systems","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128817175"

One area where humans are still in the center and where the ideas of Industry 4.0 have hardly been implemented is the construction industry, in particular the area of construction machinery. Progressive digitization could here (i) avoid dangerous and health-endangering situations, (ii) make work more attractive, make it easier or (partially) automate it, and (iii) create additional business areas. To meet these challenges, new concepts for human-machine interaction systems must be developed that bring the digital construction site closer and make work safer and more efficient. As a first step in this direction, this paper presents an approach for the remote control of an excavator. Besides the actual control, the focus is on which user interface components are needed for efficient and safe control. For this purpose, we present the results of a user study conducted within the framework of the Human Centered Design approach.

Many technologies were adapted, namely human-robot interaction order system, path planning and mapping in indoor, Robot Operating System (ROS), and Cyber Physical System (CPS). Many subsystems are developed and constructed based on ROS to implement a human-interaction action in completing service robot tasks. A human-robot interaction order system is designed for the convenient human servicing purpose. Therefore, the customer quickly finds the commodity information through the internet. This system recommends the commodity according to the content of the database. In addition, the customer makes an order by touch screen interface, and then it sends a command to control the robot to deliver the commodity.

Nevertheless, time and resources required to complete digital models (point clouds, 3D meshes and HBIM model) are extensive and this can cause interruption of knowledge communication among professionals. The VERBuM project (Virtual Enhanced Reality For Building Modelling) aims at investigating how a central Virtual Technical Tour (VTT), would guarantee a continuous stream of information when other disruptive technologies are integrated in the process and their related products are linked to the VTT. The use of a VTT, based on 360° photos, may fill time and resources gaps as it is a rapid up-to-date and high-fidelityto-reality tool. The fostering of the paradigmatic change in refurbishment/restoration process requires the development of all-in-one digital environments for digital twinning of cultural and architectural heritage and its assessment, aware of potentialities and criticalities to be overcame. The research moves from stakeholders' information requirements to implement the VERBuM process supported by the central VTT, editable via cloud-based platform (VERBuM product) to exchange digital contents, uploaded in different file format, but consulted in VR by all the involved actors via web services, without any software product installation.

However, current research pays scant attention to the multi-scale features of shop-floor, which hinders the effective application of digital twin shop-floor. As for the problem about how to realize the model construction from the perspective of time-scale and space-scale, this paper firstly proposed a multi-layer modeling framework for supporting model construction from unit layer to system layer to system of system layer.

Thus, dating the state and the evolution of the elements requires a special treatment, including the application of both advanced numerical analysis and non-invasive data acquisition techniques. In the latter, making digital copies of geometries through 3D reconstruction models is of great interest to compare and analyse structural evolutionary data accurately. For this purpose, appropriate software with containers of information correlated to the parametric elements in a BIM environment should be used. However, it is imperative to advance from static to dynamic models to collect the structural transformations caused by both the pass of time and other factors. The methodology followed in this paper is based on the experimentation by creating digital twins. The portico of a courtyard in a historical building from the 18th century was used as test bed. Based on the bibliographical recommendations, the terrestrial laser scanner is applied as a technique to acquire accurate data. The point cloud is used as a referential auxiliary to survey the model in the BIM platform with the Revit software. To assess the quality of the model built and to analyse the structural deviations between the parametric model and the actual geometry, the Dynamo script is used. To validate the experimentation, structural deviations are measured using both the parametric model and the point cloud with CloudCompare, a software for data treatment. The results were very positive because the deviation between the data obtained by Dynamo© and CloudCompare in the most unfavourable construction unit was between 0.5 and 1.17 cm, so these techniques are highly appropriate to review visual records and to analyse structural deviations. This new approach presents a new gap in the 3D reconstruction to date and control architectural structures, particularly in historical buildings. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cultural management; Generative algorithms; HBIM; Structural systems reverse engineering; Terrestrial laser scanning","Architectural design; Data acquisition; Historic preservation; Image reconstruction; Laser applications; Cultural management; Generative algorithms; HBIM; Historical buildings; Parametric models; Point-clouds; Structural deviations; Structural system reverse engineering; Structural systems; Terrestrial laser scanning; Three dimensional computer graphics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118890998"

Cybersecurity is a general topic, and the construction sector has been borrowing general solutions and frameworks. However, the construction industry is specific and needs a specialized framework that would assist in understanding and managing cybersecurity. We have studied general cybersecurity frameworks, cybersecurity standards, research literature, and first principles of systems theory and process engineering. Drawing from that, we developed an original framework that identifies three kinds of wrongful activities: stealing, lying, and harming. It identifies four elements that can be affected by wrongful activities: information asset, material asset, person, and system. It defines cybersecurity as the absence of the three wrongs across the four kinds of elements. The framework is construction-specific, and as such, a useful tool for senior management to understand security problems and organize security processes. It can lead to better standardization and also helps the researchers to structure future work on the topic. The latter should be concentrated in areas where construction was found to be different: the dynamic and overlapping process and organizational boundaries in the design stage, the exposed shared design information, and the vulnerability of control information of the built environment, particularly in critical infrastructures. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BIM; CIA Triad; Confidentiality; Construction 4.0; Cyber-Physical Systems; Cybersecurity; Digital twins; Digitalization; Information Technology (IT); Integrity; Operational Technology (OT); Parkerian Hexad; Privacy","Architectural design; Construction industry; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; BIM; CIA triad; Confidentiality; Construction 4.0; Cyber security; Digitalization; Information technology; Integrity; Operational technologies; Operational technology; Parkerian hexad; Privacy; Cybersecurity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117799886"

Sensors assist each other to provide a wealth of perception information about the internal state of the robot and the external surrounding environment. This paper proposes a method for optimizing the Support Vector Machine (SVM) multi-classifier with a binary tree structure, which improves the accuracy of multi-modal tactile signal recognition. The improved particle swarm clustering algorithm is used to optimize the binary tree structure, reduce the error accumulation of the binary tree structure SVM multi-classifier, and further improve the accuracy of multi-modal tactile signal recognition. The effect of the method in this paper is verified by robot grasping experiments. The results show that the use of multi-modal information of two-dimensional images and three-dimensional point cloud images can effectively identify and locate target objects of different shapes. Compared with the processing method of two-dimensional or point cloud monomodal image information, the positioning error can be reduced by 54.8%, and the direction error can be reduced by 50.8%, which has better robustness and accuracy. The simulation results show that the improved PSOBT-SVM model has the best classification effect for artificial features, PCA features and spatio-temporal correlation features. The improved PSOBT-SVM optimizes the classification accuracy without changing the number of SVM classifiers, and proves its accuracy in classifying multimodal tactile signals. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyber–physical system; Inclusive robot; Multi-modal perception; PSO algorithm","Binary trees; Biomimetics; Classification (of information); Clustering algorithms; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Errors; Intelligent robots; Mobile robots; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Signal processing; Trees (mathematics); Binary tree structure; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Inclusive robot; Multi modal perceptions; Multi-classifier; Multi-modal; PSO algorithms; Support vector machine models; Support vectors machine; Support vector machines","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117785704"

First, we conceptualize a technical architecture to connect blockchain to digital building twins. The digital building twin stores and evaluates performance data in real-time. The blockchain ensures transparency and trusted execution of automatic performance evaluation and rewards through smart contracts.

Alongside developing the physical system, a mathematical model of the physical system is constructed which is used as its digital counterpart to run simulations on and to predict future failures. In real-time operation, the mathematical model is observed to analyze system failure at a future time step. Prevention of such failures is achieved using the digital system by providing control inputs to the physical system in real time. This capability is demonstrated by constructing a what-if scenario where a failure point is forced upon the system. Subsequently, an automatic course correction is observed by the digital twin to prevent the potential catastrophe.

This paper aims to develop a novel conceptual model for the implementation of blockchain technology (BCT) for digital twin(s) (DT) in the BECOM industry 4.0 to improve trust, cyber security, efficiencies, information management, information sharing, and sustainability. A PESTELS approach is used to review the literature and identify the key challenges affecting BCT adoption for the BECOM industry 4.0. A review of the technical literature on BCT combined with the findings from PESTELS analysis permitted researchers to identify the key technological factors affecting BCT adoption in the industry. This allowed offering a technological framework—namely, the decentralized digital twin cycle (DDTC)—that leverages BCT to address the key technological factors and to ultimately enhance trust, security, decentralization, efficiency, traceability, and transparency of information throughout projects’ lifecycles. The study also identifies the gaps in the integration of BCT with key technologies of industry 4.0, including the internet of things (IoT), building information modeling (BIM), and DT. The framework offered addresses key technological factors and narrows key gaps around network governance, scalability, decentralization, interoperability, energy efficiency, computational requirements, and BCT integration with IoT, BIM, and DT throughout projects’ lifecycles. The model also considers the regulatory aspect and the environmental aspect, and the circular economy (CE). The theoretical framework provides key technological building blocks for industry practitioners to develop the DDTC concept further and implement it through experimental works.

Blockchain can improve data integrity and enhance trust in the data value chain throughout the entire lifecycle of projects. This paper aims to develop a novel theoretical framework for the adoption of environmentally sustainable blockchain-based digital twins (BCDT) for Construction Industry (CI) 4.0. The paper identifies which key data from construction projects lifecycle should be anchored in BCDTs to benefit CI 4.0 and the environment. The paper also identifies key factors and non-functional requirements necessary for the adoption of BCDTs in a decentralized and sustainable CI 4.0. At first, a content analysis of the literature allowed the identification of which data from projects lifecycle would benefit from blockchain technology (BCT) adoption and what the key factors and non-functional requirements necessary for the adoption of BCDT in the CI4.0 are. Furthermore, the analysis of structured interviews and online survey permitted to firstly validate the hypotheses raised from the literature and to offer a novel framework for BCDT of CI 4.0 in the context of the circular economy (CE). The findings are that (1) the key project lifecycle data relevant for BCDTs relate to the BIM dimensions (3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D, and 8D) and a new dimension called the contractual dimension (cD) is also proposed. (2) Ecosystems of BCDTs should embrace a novel form of collaboration that is decentralized and presented as Level 4 maturity for BCDTs. This new level of maturity leverages distributed blockchain networks to enhance collaboration, processes automation with smart contracts, and data sharing within a decentralized data value chain. Finally (3), the main non-functional requirements for BCDTs are security, privacy, interoperability, data ownership, data integrity, and the decentralization and scalability of data storage.

MiC offers a range of benefits including cost-effectiveness, high productivity, and high sustainability for construction industry. Multiple stakeholders in MiC project, such as project client, module manufacturer, logistics company, and building contractor, normally use their own proprietary and centralized Enterprise Information System (EIS). However, stakeholders are facing challenges to share information throughout MiC projects. “Islands of Information” issue is commonly existing and creates information fragmentation and discontinuity. As an emerging Information and Communication Technology (ICT), blockchain provides unified standards and protocols for information sharing based on decentralized P2P framework with enhanced transparency and security. Aiming to address the information fragmentation and discontinuity in MiC project, this paper proposes a blockchain-enabled cyber-physical smart MiC platform to facilitate cross-enterprise information sharing among multiple stakeholders based on User-Centered Design (UCD) method. A practical roadmap is presented for the design, development, deployment, and application of MiC blockchain with new opportunities and guidelines. Initial investigations based on an industrial collaborated company are analyzed and the blockchain-enabled cyber-physical MiC workflow is designed. The user-centered blockchain explorers with high-fidelity digital twins are illustrated. Some preliminary results are found that MiC blockchain not only facilitates cyber-physical construction progress traceability, and real-time KPI visualization & evaluation, but also improves the information reliability, immutability, and transparency in MiC projects. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Cyber-Physical System (CPS); Information communication and sharing; Modular Integrated Construction (MiC)","Construction industry; Cost effectiveness; Cyber Physical System; Information analysis; Information dissemination; Transparency; Block-chain; Construction projects; Cybe-physical system; Cyber physicals; Information communication; Information sharing; Innovative solutions; Modular integrated construction; Modulars; Multiple stakeholders; Embedded systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117186354"

The difficulty of pedestrian segmentation lies in the scene's complexity where the pedestrian is located, including the pedestrian's shooting angle, light, and obstructions, which makes it difficult to distinguish accurately. This paper proposes an S-Mask-RCNN network that integrates spatial attention mechanisms for pedestrian segmentation. Mask-RCNN uses residual neural networks in the feature extraction network, and the effect of model feature extraction is not ideal. Based on transfer learning, a spatial attention mechanism is introduced to focus more spatially on areas that need attention. The force mechanism focuses more on the areas that need attention in space. Experiments show that the S-Mask-RCNN method proposed in this paper has better performance than traditional Mask-RCNN in pedestrian segmentation.

However, the instability and sudden failure of physical sensors pose challenges to the monitoring of dredging process. To address these issues, we propose a structure of digital twin-driven virtual sensor (DTDVS) for the construction safety of TSHD. Considering the potential internal relations among construction data, we compare the performance of four machine learning algorithms in predicting the torsional vibration in mechanical failure. The results showed that these algorithms provide high prediction accuracy (R2 > 0.9). Then the DBN model with the best performance was selected as a part of the virtual sensors to predict and analyze the status of TSHD. The digital twin technology provides a more stable and environmentally friendly scheme for TSHD construction safety control. On the one hand, the DTDVS assists physical sensors to monitor the construction state, overcoming the limitation of the sensors on detection targets which are difficult or costly to measure directly. On the other hand, by analyzing the residual between the physical sensor and the virtual sensor, the construction behavior can be diagnosed, and the fault situation can be pre-warned accurately. This improves the time utilization of TSHD and provides an important guarantee for the construction safety. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Construction safety; Data mining; Digital twin; Machine learning; Trailing suction hopper dredger; Virtual sensor","Dredging; E-learning; Failure (mechanical); Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Vibrations (mechanical); Construction data; Construction operations; Construction safety; Machine learning algorithms; Performance; Physical sensors; Safe operation; Stable operation; Trailing suction hopper dredger; Virtual sensor; Data mining","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115307160"

First, an automatic production line for spraying operations is designed in which the spraying equipment can be remotely controlled. Then, multiple sensors are used to collect the environmental and equipment conditions. After that, multisource heterogeneous data are pretreated to construct a unified data template and interfaces.

Additionally, the relevant support database and knowledge base are established; a fault diagnosis method based on knowledge is proposed to provide support for fault treatment. Finally, an automatic spraying monitoring and tele-operation software platform is developed that can run under monitoring or tele-operation mode, and the related functions are tested and verified.

However, few construction methods, standards, and specifications of closed test fields for testing CAV were reported with details.

The process of integrating Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Internet of Things (IoT) technology, will become the trend in future construction of smart factories. In the past, smart factories were developed around the concept of the Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS). Most parts of the quality management process still needed to be implemented by Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) methods which required human resources and time to perform second stage testing. Screening standards also resulted in the elimination of about 30% of the products. In this study, we sort and analyze several Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) and YOLO models that are currently more advanced and widely used, analyze the methods and development problems of the various models, and propose a suitable real-time image recognition model and architecture suitable for Integrated Circuit Board (ICB) in manufacturing process. The goal of the first stage of this study is to collect and use different types of ICBs as model training data sets, and establish a preliminary image recognition model that can classify and predict different types of ICBs based on different feature points. The second stage explores image augmentation fusion and optimization methods. The data augmentation method used in this study can reach an average accuracy of 96.53%. In the final stage, there is discussion of the applicability of the model to detect and recognize the ICB directionality in <1 s with a 98% accuracy rate to meet the real-time requirements of smart manufacturing.

To easily identify such constructional modifications, this paper proposes a smart digital twin for construction site monitoring that supports web-based collaboration with external experts to discuss possibly required solutions to this problem. Therefore, a system pipeline was designed that allows automatic detection and visualization of deviations between real and planning data. In addition, the pipeline allows generating an interactive difference visualization that uses the original planning data as well as the 3D scanned real data. The latter is recorded using an AR-capable mobile device or headset like the Microsoft HoloLens, whereas the mentioned differences are obtained via a point-cloud-based algorithm. The differences between real and planning data are then emphasized on the respective client, which uses X3DOM for visualization. Besides the server part of the pipeline, the application consists of several clients that enable a collaborative discussion between the various stakeholders, such as an AR-based mobile viewer for the craftsman on site and a web-based viewer for the building owner at home or the architect. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3D Geometry Comparison; Collaborative Construction Site Monitoring; Geometry Deviation Feedback; Mobile Mixed Reality; Web-based Difference Visualization","Data visualization; Mixed reality; Pipelines; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; 3D geometry; 3d geometry comparison; Collaborative construction; Collaborative construction site monitoring; Construction sites; Difference visualization; Geometry deviation feedback; Geometry deviations; Mobile mixed realities; Site monitoring; Web based; Web-based difference visualization; Websites","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121702854"

This paper first affirms that the knowledge created by virtue of DT real-world implementation, through undertaking various DT pilot projects, case studies and proof-of-concept initiatives, comprises the 'know-how' and genuine practical experience upon which the DT research and practices can further develop and mature. It then argues that this type of knowledge is poorly captured and mostly left neither realized nor fully utilized. This significantly hinders the rate by which DT practices within the urban and built environments evolve. While acknowledging the benefits of the ongoing work by many DT researchers, including enumeration, categorization and detailing of multiple DT use cases, such endeavours arguably suffer from three profound weaknesses causing the inefficient sharing and transfer of DT 'know-how' knowledge amongst DT stakeholders. The three limitations are: (a) lack of DT standard terminology constituting a common DT language; (b) lack of standard and clear methods to enable documenting DT projects and making the 'know-how' explicit to the rest of the DT market; and (c) the lack of an established and adequate DT use cases classifications system to guide DT practitioners in searching for and retrieving the previously accomplished DT case studies that are most relevant to their interests and context. Correspondingly, three solutions are proposed constituting a three-pronged DT Uses Classification System [DTUCS]: prong-A (i.e. Standardize-to-Publish); prong-B (i.e. Detail-to-Prove); and prong-C (i.e. Classify-to-Reach). DTUCS is developed using a meta-methodology encapsulating a systematic literature review and three distinct sub-methodologies. The paper concludes with an overview of the implications of DTUCS along with recommendations on how it can be further validated and improved. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Twin (DT); Knowledge transfer; Standards; Urban; Use-case","C (programming language); Technology transfer; Urban planning; Case-studies; Classification system; Digital twin; Infrastructure managements; Knowledge transfer; Pilot programs; Project case; Real-world implementation; Urban; Use-case; Knowledge management","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120358598"

Digitalisation is a strategy to increase the sector’s productivity, competitiveness, and efficiency. However, digitalisation also impacts environmental goals, such as those concerning more eco-friendly solutions, energy efficiency, products recycling, and sustainability certifications. These strategies rely on data, understood as digital, interoperable, incremental and traceable. Data related concepts, such as digital data templates (DDT) and digital building logbooks (DBL), contribute to “good data”. Despite some research focused on each one, little importance has yet been given to their combination. Relevant relationships and overlaps exist, as they partially share the exact same data through the built environment life cycle. This research aims to provide improved understanding on the role of these concepts and their contribution to a more circular industry. The review develops conceptualisations where DDT and DBL are complementary and framed within an incremental digital twin construction (DTC). Misconceptions or confrontations between these three solutions can therefore stand down, for the benefit of a data-driven priority. To increase understanding and reduce misconceptions, our study developed the “Digital data-driven concept” (D3c). This concept contribution is the ability to structure, store, and trace data, opening way to streamlined digital transformation impacting circular built environment concerns. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Building logbook; Concepts overlap; Construction 4.0; Data templates; Digitalisation; Traceability","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119930926"

The project is aimed at integrating Construction 4.0 content to a recently started new degree on Technologies on Civil Engineering. This integration is underpinned by the creation of STEAM-rich activities that can complement such degree. The philosophical design of these activities followed three requirements: (i) the activities should infuse Construction 4.0-related technologies, (ii) the activities should foster motivation among students with a STEAM vision by-design and (iii) the activities should be designed with a hardware-software independent perspective (open-source, accessible, affordable). Cornerstone and capstone projects as well as a set of workshops represent the demonstrators of these activities. All these demonstrators are knitted together in a single path in which an educational attempt to fill the identified Construction 4.0 gaps is proposed. The STEAM perspective provides completeness to the whole development. During the last two years, the project was developed and the design, the development and implementation of several demonstrators were completed. In the years to come, a systematic deployment and analysis of such demonstrators is expected when a full implementation of the new degree of Technologies in Civil Engineering will be addressed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3D printing; BIM; Construction 4.0; Digital twins; Education; Robotics; STEAM; TLS","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118999460"

A considerable number of drones are deployed worldwide as they can be used in many applications, providing a broad range of services, such as monitoring the surrounding environment, delivering services, in farming, and in rescue activities from disasters to accidents. This expansion is fostering the development of a comprehensive approach, including the construction of general systems, such as cyber-physical systems and IoT middleware platforms. In terms of the quantitative aspects of the drone industry, we still have many issues to solve and improve, such as privacy protection, human safety, improvement in resources, and specifically, power consumption and efficiency. To overcome these problems, systems must be able to generate an efficient and easy-to-follow path that is able to dynamically adjust to new situations. Thus, we propose an ONLINE/OFFLINE path planning algorithm and evaluate the results of a simulation using a drone kit with a software-in-the-loop simulator.

On the other hand, robots are adept at performing numerical computation and repetitive physical tasks with precise motion control. The unstructured and complex nature of construction environments and the inability to maintain tight tolerances in assembled workpieces pose several unique challenges to the wide application of robots in construction work. Thus, the robotization of field construction processes is best conceived as a collaborative human-robot endeavor that takes advantage of both human and robot intelligence as well as robots' physical operation capabilities to overcome uncertainties and successfully perform useful construction work onsite. This paper proposes an interactive and immersive process-level digital twin (I2PL-DT) system in virtual reality (VR) that integrates visualization and supervision, task planning and execution, and bidirectional communication to enable collaborative human-robot construction work. In this work paradigm, the human worker is responsible for high-level task planning and work process supervision. The robot undertakes workspace sensing and monitoring, detailed motion planning, and physical execution of the work. A drywall installation case study involving imperfect rough carpentry (wall framing) is presented using a KUKA mobile industrial robotic arm emulator. A human-in-the-loop study involving 20 subjects was conducted for system verification and to collect feedback for future improvements. The experimental results show that users can use the system to specify work sequences, select optimal task plans, and perform robot trajectory guidance after simple training and felt positive about the system functions and user experience. The system demonstrates the potential of transitioning the role of construction workers from physical task performers to robot supervisors. In addition, the system establishes a promising framework for construction workers to remotely collaborate with onsite construction robots. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Construction robots; Digital twin; Human-robot collaboration; Immersive virtual reality","Biofeedback; Digital twin; Educational robots; Industrial robots; Social robots; User experience; Virtual reality; Bi-directional communication; Construction environment; Construction process; Construction workers; Numerical computations; On-site construction; Robot intelligences; System verifications; Robot programming","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114032838"

Moreover, the development of semantic modeling and digital perception provides the feasibility for the application of DT in the manufacturing industry. However, the application of DT technology in assembly workshop modeling and management is immature for the discreteness of assembly process, diversity of assembly resource, and complexity of dataflow in the assembly task execution. A method of ontology-based modeling and evolution of DT for the assembly workshop is proposed to deal with this situation. Firstly, the ontology-based modeling method is given for the assembly resource and process. By instantiating in the ontology, resources and processes can be involved in the modeling and evolution of the DT workshop. Secondly, the DT assembly workshop framework is introduced with the detailed discussions of dataflow mapping, DT evolution, storage, and tracing of historical data generated during the operation of the workshop. In addition, a case study is illustrated to show the entire process of construction and evolution of the DT modeled on an experimental field, indicating the feasibility and validity of the method proposed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assembly workshop; Dataflow; Digital twin evolution; Digital twin modeling; Historical data; Ontology","Data flow analysis; Digital storage; Digital twin; Ontology; Semantics; Assembly process; Assembly resources; Assembly tasks; Assembly workshop; Historical data; Manufacturing industries; Ontology based modeling; Production system; Assembly","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111482663"

The characteristics of the excavator-environment interaction are modeled as a spring-mass-damper system with two degrees of freedom, and used in the proposed control system. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a simulation using the model. The control performance is improved by applying the proposed method to the controlled object whose characteristics are subject to change. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","database-driven approach; digital transformation; digital twin; hydraulic excavator; model predictive control; modeling","Construction equipment; Database systems; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Excavation; Excavators; Predictive control systems; Construction sites; Control performance; Database-driven approach; Digital transformation; Hydraulic excavator; Model-predictive control; Modeling; Object characteristics; Spring-mass-damper system; Two-degree-of-freedom; Model predictive control","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119501745"

Aiming at the low efficiency of quality problems traceability, poor timeliness and unpredictability of quality control in the machining process, digital twin technology can provide a new intelligent solution based on interaction and integration between physical workshop and virtual workshop. Therefore, a digital twin-driven approach towards traceability and dynamic control for processing quality is proposed in the paper. Firstly, a Bayesian network model for the analysis of factors affecting processing quality (BN_PQ) is introduced, which determines the relevance and influence weight of each factor to processing quality. Secondly, in order to integrate multi-source heterogeneous data to trace the processing quality, a multi-level scalable information model and association mechanism are established. Moreover, the construction method of the IoT system in manufacturing unit for dynamic control of processing quality are introduced, in which the collection method of real-time data is discussed. The contents of digital twin data for processing quality constraints (DTD_PQ) and the management method are elaborated. Then, the digital twin-driven dynamic control method of processing quality is proposed. The conceptual model of the digital twin database and the operating logic for dynamic control of processing quality are described in detail. Finally, the interactive operation and core technologies of DTD_PQ towards traceability and dynamic control of processing quality are analyzed. By choosing examples of machining the connecting rod of diesel engine and the prototype system that has been developed, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin; IoT system; Processing quality; Simulation optimization; Traceability and dynamic control","Bayesian networks; Data handling; Digital twin; Dynamics; Machining; Manufacturing data processing; Bayesian network models; Collection methods; Construction method; Information Modeling; Intelligent Manufacturing; Intelligent solutions; Interactive operations; Manufacturing units; Quality control","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113426145"

Also, what the DT can bring to the civil engineering industry is still ambiguous. To address these problems, we reviewed 468 articles related to DT, BIM and CPS, proposed a DT definition and its constituents in civil engineering and compared DT with BIM and CPS.

By analyzing the hidden physical meaning of CCPAs, a cyber-physical FDIA with CCPA as a special case is proposed to establish the connection between FDIA and CCPA. Based on a discrete-time system dynamic model, an adaptive nonparametric cumulative sum (AN-CUSUM) detector is devised to deal with FDIAs and CCPAs simultaneously. The AN-CUSUM algorithm estimates the abnormal change of the state vector caused by attacks one step in advance and standardizes the decision statistics of conventional cumulative sum (CUSUM) to simplify the setting of thresholds. The proposed detector is robust to a wide range of time-varying system states and attack magnitudes. Moreover, a verification method is designed in the proposed detector to differentiate CCPAs and FDIAs according to unique characteristics of CCPAs, namely, the construction of CCPAs depends on the physical system parameter. Numerical results reveal that the proposed detector is more reliable to detect both FDIAs and CCPAs than existing CUSUM-based methods. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive nonparametric cumulative sum (AN-CUSUM); attack detection; coordinated cyber-physical attack (CCPA); false data injection attack (FDIA)","Cyber Physical System; Digital control systems; Discrete time control systems; Numerical methods; Online systems; Signal detection; Time varying systems; Decision statistics; Discrete - time systems; False data injection attacks; Numerical results; On-line detection; Physical meanings; Real-time detection; Verification method; Real time systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101463995"

The process of virtual commissioning involves the creation of a Digital Twin—a dynamic, virtual representation of a corresponding physical system. The digital twin model can be used for testing and verifying the control system in a simulated virtual environment to achieve rapid set-up and optimization prior to physical commissioning. Additionally, the modular production control systems, can be integrated and tested during or prior to the construction of the physical system. This paper describes the implementation of a digital twin emulator of an automated mechatronic modular production system that is linked with the running programmable logic controllers and allow for exchanging near real-time information with the physical system. The development and deployment of the digital twin emulator involves a novel hybrid simulation- and data-driven modeling approach that combines Discrete Event Simulation and Agent Based Modeling paradigms. The Digital Twin Emulator can support design decisions, test what-if system configurations, verify and validate the actual behavior of the complete system off-line, test realistic reactions, and provide statistics on the system’s performance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agent based modeling; Automation; Digital twin; Discrete event simulation; Emulator; Hybrid simulation; Modular production","Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Control systems; Discrete event simulation; Production control; Programmable logic controllers; Virtual addresses; Agent-based model; Early design phasis; Hybrid simulation; Modular production; Modular production system; System configurations; Virtual commissioning; Virtual representations; Digital twin","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098992291"

Its CPS translation generates λ-terms in which continuation composition is not expressed in terms of nested function calls, as is typical of other delimited-control operators, e.g. shift, but with function applications consuming a sequence of continuations one at a time, as if they formed a stack. We present a novel reduction theory for Moggi's computational λ-calculus extended with shift0 and a control delimiter dollar, which models the capture of evaluation contexts in a fine-grained manner as an interaction between the let-expressions and the delimiter. We establish a connection between our reduction theory and the existing theories of shif0 and dollar. Moreover, we develop a CPS translation for our calculus along with a direct-style translation that together form a reflection, i.e. the translations preserve reductions and the direct-style translation is a right inverse of the CPS translation. This construction relies on the invariant that CPS root terms are in •-head-normal form. The results of this work could potentially be used for compiler optimisations and lead to a similar development for algebraic effects. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","continuation-passing style; delimited control; lambda calculus; reflection","Algebra; Calculations; Computation theory; Computational mechanics; Semantics; Algebraic effects; Continuation-passing style; Control operators; Delimited control; Delimiters; Direct styles; Fine grained; Lambda-calculi; Operational semantics; Reduction theory; Differentiation (calculus)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117697513"

The adoption of I4.0 principles in Disaster Risk Management (DRM) research and associated industry practices is particularly notable, although its origins, impacts and potential are not well understood. In response to this knowledge gap, this paper conducts a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis of the application and contribution of I4.0 in DRM. The systematic literature review identified 144 relevant articles and then employed descriptive and content analysis of a focused set of 70 articles published between 2011 and 2021. The results of this review trace the growing trend for adoption of I4.0 tools and techniques in disaster management, and in parallel their influence in resilient infrastructure and digital construction fields. The results are used to identify six dominant clusters of research activity: big data analytics, Internet of Things, prefabrication and modularization, robotics and cyber-physical systems. The research in each cluster is then mapped to the priorities of the Sendai framework for DRR, highlighting the ways it can support this international agenda.

Two main threats have made the reliable and real-time control of these systems challenging: (i) uncertainty in the communication infrastructure induced by scale, and heterogeneity of the environment and devices; and (ii) targeted attacks maliciously worsening the impact of the above-mentioned communication uncertainties, disrupting the correctness of real-time applications. This article addresses those challenges by showing how to build distributed protocols that provide both real-time with practical performance, and scalability in the presence of network faults and attacks, in probabilistic synchronous environments. We provide a suite of real-time Byzantine protocols, which we prove correct, starting from a reliable broadcast protocol, called PISTIS, up to atomic broadcast and consensus. This suite simplifies the construction of powerful distributed and decentralized monitoring and control applications, including state-machine replication. Extensive empirical simulations showcase PISTIS's robustness, latency, and scalability. For example, PISTIS can withstand message loss (and delay) rates up to 50 percent in systems with 49 nodes and provides bounded delivery latencies in the order of a few milliseconds. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","atomic broadcast; Byzantine resilience; consensus; intrusion tolerance; probabilistic losses; Real-time distributed systems","Real time control; Scalability; Communication infrastructure; Decentralized monitoring; Distributed protocols; Empirical simulations; Real-time application; Reliable broadcast; State machine replication; Technological evolution; Embedded systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100838125"

This requires a flexible, iterative development process in which different parts of the system under construction are built and updated concurrently. However, concurrent engineering becomes quite challenging in domains where different engineering artifacts from different disciplines come into play, such as safety-critical cyber-physical systems, where the involved engineering artifacts are quite heterogeneous in nature. In such systems, it is of utmost importance that different artifacts remain consistent in order to guarantee a correctly functioning end product. In this article, we discuss our experiences (with a leading company working in the areas of production automation and product processing) in maintaining the consistency between electrical models and the corresponding software controller, when both are subject to continuous changes. The article discusses how we let engineers describe the relationships between electrical models and the corresponding software controller code in the form of links and consistency rules.

It is pointed out that the distinctive features of modern cyber-physical systems are their high complexity and constantly changing structure and behavior, which complicates the data acquisition procedure. To solve this problem, it is proposed to use an approach according to which the data acquisition procedure is divided into two phases: model construction and data acquisition, which allows parallel realization of these procedures. A distinctive feature of the developed approach is that the models are built in runtime automatically. As a top-level model, a multi-level relative finite state operational automaton is used. The automaton state is described using a multi-level structural-behavioral model, which is a superposition of four graphs: the workflow graph, the data flow graph, the request flow graph and the resource graph. To implement the data acquisition procedure using the model, the context-sensitive policy mechanism is used. The article discusses possible approaches to implementation of suggested mechanisms and describes an example of application. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Context-aware systems; Cyber-physical systems; Data acquisition; Fog platforms; Multi-level relative finite state operational automaton; Policy-based systems","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113381351"

The DT is a Product Life Management information construct that has migrated to the built environment while research on the subject has grown intensely in recent years. Common to early research phases, DT research in the built environment has developed organically, setting the basis for mature definitions and robust research frameworks. As DT research in manufacturing is the most developed, this paper seeks to advance the understanding of DTs in the built environment by analysing how the DT systems reported in manufacturing literature are structured and how they function. Firstly, this paper presents a thorough review and a comparison of DT, cyber-physical systems (CPS), and building information modelling (BIM). Then, the results of the review and categorisation of DT structural and functional descriptions are presented. Fifty-four academic publications and industry reports were reviewed, and their structural and functional descriptions were analysed in detail. Three types of structural models (i.e. conceptual models, system architectures, and data models) and three types of functional models (process and communication models) were identified. DT maturity models were reviewed as well. From the reviewed descriptions, four categories of DT conceptual models (prototypical, model-based, interface-oriented, and service-based) and six categories of DT process models (DT creation, DT synchronisation, asset monitoring, prognosis and simulation, optimal operations, and optimised design) were defined and its applicability to the AECO assessed. While model-based and service-based models are the most applicable to the built environment, amendments are still required. Prognosis and simulation process models are the most widely applicable for AECO use-cases. The main contribution to knowledge of this study is that it compiles the DT's structural and functional descriptions used in manufacturing and it provides the basis to develop DT conceptual and process models specific to requirements of the built environment sectors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BIM; Conceptual Models; Cyber-Physical Systems; Digital Twin; Maturity Models; Process Models","Architectural design; Digital twin; E-learning; Embedded systems; Engineering education; Information theory; Manufacture; Academic publications; Building Information Modelling; Communication models; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Product life managements; Research frameworks; Service-based model; System architectures; Industrial research","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107992986"

DT technology has the potential to transform the construction industry and provide responses to some of its challenges. As a result, the concept of DT has attracted much attention and is developing at a rapid pace. The overarching aim of this study was to analyse the current state of DT applications in the construction industry. This study comprehensively reviews and analyses DT concept, technologies, and application in the construction industry using a systematic review methodology while incorporating the science mapping method. After a complete search of several databases and careful selection in line with the proposed criteria, 22 academic publications about DT application in the construction industry were identified and classified accordingly. The research analysed in detail the status, evolution of the concept, key technologies, and six areas of application in the lifecycle phases of a project: building information modeling, structural system integrity, facilities management, monitoring, logistics processes, and energy simulation. This research shows that there is a high potential for DT to enable solutions to the numerous challenges in the construction industry.

The impact of a cooling pipe system (CPS) on a reinforced concrete (RC) tank wall where early-age cracks developed during construction has been analyzed. It has been proven that for RC tanks, the factor that contributes most to tensile stresses in the semimassive walls is the mean temperature of the maturing concrete. The second most influential factor is derived from self-stresses, and the least influential factor is the stress gradient. The calculations of self-stresses indicate that the use of a CPS leads to the formation of favorable compressive rather than tensile stresses in the central part of the wall. Most importantly, a CPS in RC tank walls significantly reduces the width of cracks that result from the cumulative effect of early-age and long-term imposed strains. The performed analysis provides a basis for the effective design of a CPS in RC tank semimassive walls. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Concrete construction; Cooling pipe system (CPS); Cracks; Hydration age; Reinforced concrete (RC) tank","Tanks (containers); Tensile stress; Cumulative effects; Early age cracking; Financial savings; Imposed strains; Influential factors; Internal cooling; Mean temperature; Stress gradient; Reinforced concrete","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104686506"

The application of this technology expands from built environment disciplines such as construction, and planning, to manufacturing and health care. The underlying concept of digital twin as a “dynamic software model of a physical thing or system” creates under‐explored opportunities in various disciplines. The research team tested a model of digital twin by combining RFID and BIM technologies in order to integrate different type of real‐time data, from environmental data to student movement, to create a useful tool for data driven decision making across campus units.

BIM contains different types of data and information about a building including 3D (geometry), 4D (time), 5D (cost), 6D (facility management) and 7D (sustainability). Once constructed, this 'digital twin' of the building allows for adding new services and for stakeholders interacting with the building design through through sensors, immersive experiences and virtual, augmented and mixed realities.

Construction 4.0 brings to the table a plethora of technologies and associated processes over the construction project lifecycle. The current study performs a state-of-art literature review to summarize the knowledge advancement in construction 4.0. A layered conceptualization spanning across project lifecycle utilizing the people-process-technology dimensions is presented to summarize the current understanding of Construction 4.0. The cyber-physical space is classified into the physical, digital tool, data, and core data security and interoperability layers. The inter-layer and intra-layer interactions and information flows are then conceptualized based on the extant literature, including the human interaction and interventions. The people-process-technology dimensions were discussed across the project lifecycle through interactions in these layers. It is observed that Construction 4.0 is set to be driven by data creation, data flow, data transformation, and data storage across the project lifecycle to ensure a collaborative environment across the stakeholders who interact and associate with different layers of Construction 4.0.

To accelerate innovation, digital twins and cyber-physical systems will be a necessity to advance automation and real-time control with these technologies. While digital twin represents a digital replica of the asplanned and as-built facility, cyber physical systems involve integration of physical systems with their digital replica through sensors and actuators.

Academics and companies have made great strides in the theoretical research and case studies of constructing the shop-floor digital twin (SDT), which is the premise of applying DT technology on the shop floor. A shop floor is a large complex system that involves many elements including people, machines, materials, methods, and the environment and processes, such as the technical flow, business process, logistics, and control flow. However, most of the developed cases lack a hierarchical, structured and modularized implementation framework for the development of an SDT system, which leads to problems such as a low reuse rate of the system blocks, lack of scalability, and high upgrade and maintenance costs. In response to these issues, we propose a construction method of the DT for the shop floor based on model-based systems engineering from the perspective of the system. In this method, a comprehensive DT model for the shop floor is gradually constructed by using system modeling language, the modeling method “MagicGrid,” and the “V model” of systems engineering. The model includes four dimensions of the shop-floor requirements, structure, behavior, and parameters, as well as three stages (the problem domain, solution domain, and implementation domain), and connects nine steps of the “V model,” including the system requirements, system architecture, subsystem implementation, subsystem integration, and system verification. Then, based on an example of a real NC machining shop floor, subsystems including a visualization system, synchronization system, and simulation system, are discussed. Finally, the functions of the integrated systems are verified based on the requirements, including the real-time synchronization of “man, machine, material, and method” and the transient simulation in real time. The numerical indicators of the integrated system are verified, including the model completeness and synchronization timeliness. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyber-physical production system; Digital twin; MagicGrid; Model-based systems engineering; Shop-floor digital twin; System modeling language","Embedded systems; Floors; Integrated control; Modeling languages; Real time systems; Synchronization; Systems engineering; Large complex systems; Model-based systems engineering; Synchronization systems; System modeling languages; System verifications; Theoretical research; Transient simulation; Visualization system; Digital twin","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106942746"

The digital twin updates building information modeling in near real-time using internet of things sensors, while the blockchain authenticates and adds confidence to all data transactions to the digital twin. The authors tested the framework with a case project where virtual positioning data from a prefabricated brick is transmitted to digital twin in near real-time, recorded on the blockchain with time stamps.

These advances push the standard approach of media architecture to embed screens in the built environment to its limits because screens lack the immersive capacity that newer media afford. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel AR approach to media architecture that uses a Digital Twin as a platform for structuring and accessing data from various sources, including IoT and simulations. Our technical contribution to media architecture is threefold. First, we extend the possibilities of media architecture beyond embedded screens to three dimensions by presenting a Digital Twin using AR with a head-mounted display. This approach results in a shared and consistent augmented experience across large architectural spaces. Second, we use the Digital Twin to integrate and visualize real physical sensor information. Third, we make artificial occupancy simulations accessible to everyday users by presenting them within their natural context in the Digital Twin. Observing the Digital Twin in situ of the Physical Twin also has applications beyond media architecture. Fusing the two twins using AR can reduce the cognitive load of users from consuming big and complex information sources and enhance their experience. We present two use cases of the proposed Fused Twins in a university building at ETH Zürich. In the first use case, we visualize a dense indoor sensor network (DISN) with 390 IoT sensors that collected data from March 2020 to May 2021. In the second use case, we immerse visitors in agent-based simulations to enable insights into the real and projected uses of space. This work brings forward an ambitious vision for media architecture beyond traditional flat screens, and showcases its potential through fusing state of the art simulations, sensor data integration and augmented reality, finally making the jump from fiction to reality. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agent-Based Modeling; Augmented Reality; Data-Driven Design; Dense Indoor Sensor Networks; Digital Twin; Fused Twins; Physical Twin","Architectural design; Augmented reality; Computational methods; Internet of things; Network architecture; Sensor networks; Simulation platform; Agent-based model; Cloud-computing; Cognitive approaches; Data-driven design; Dense indoor sensor network; Fused twin; In-buildings; Indoor sensors; Physical twin; Sensors network; Autonomous agents","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118550548"

This paper presents a new domain-specific language called PiCon for programming ML pipelines in low-resource devices. PiCon allows safe I/O-compute concurrency, ruling out a large class of errors, while providing a simple and sequential coding abstraction to the programmer. PiCon compiles to C code and easily interfaces with existing C/C++ code.

Digital twin is an ingenious concept that helps on organizing different areas of expertise aiming at supporting engineering decisions related to a specific asset; it articulates computational models, sensors, learning, real time analysis, diagnosis, prognosis, and so on. In this framework, and to leverage its capacity, we explore the integration of physics-based models with machine learning. A digital twin is constructed for a damaged structure, where a discrete physics-based computational model is employed to investigate several damage scenarios. A machine learning classifier, that serves as the digital twin, is trained with data taken from a stochastic computational model. This strategy allows the use of an interpretable model (physics-based) to build a fast digital twin (machine learning) that will be connected to the physical twin to support real time engineering decisions. Different classifiers (quadratic discriminant, support vector machines, etc) are tested, and different model parameters (number of sensors, level of noise, damage intensity, uncertainty, operational parameters, etc) are considered to construct datasets for the training. The accuracy of the digital twin depends on the scenario analyzed. Through the chosen application, we are able to emphasize each step of a digital twin construction, including the possibility of integrating physics-based models with machine learning. The different scenarios explored yield conclusions that might be helpful for a large range of applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Damage identification; Digital twin; Machine learning classifier; Physical based model; Structural dynamics","Classification (of information); Computational methods; Damage detection; Digital twin; Dynamical systems; E-learning; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Support vector machines; Turing machines; Computational model; Damaged structures; Engineering decisions; Operational parameters; Physics-based modeling; Physics-based models; Quadratic discriminants; Real time analysis; Learning systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099782415"

The specification and design of such systems usually rely on the description of both continuous and discrete behaviours. From complex embedded systems to autonomous vehicles, these systems became quite common, including in safety critical domains. However, their formal verification and validation as a whole is still a challenge. To address this challenge, this article contributes to the definition of a reusable and tool supported formal framework handling the design and verification of hybrid system models that integrate both discrete (the controller part) and continuous (the plant part) behaviours. This framework includes the development of a process for defining a class of basic theories and developing domain theories and then the use of these theories to develop a generic model and system-specific models. To realise this framework, we present a formal proof tool chain, based on the Event-B correct-by-construction method and its integrated development environment Rodin, to develop a set of theories, a generic model, proof processes, and the required properties for designing hybrid systems in Event-B. Our approach relies on hybrid automata as basic models for such systems. Discrete and continuous variables model system states and behaviours are given using discrete state changes and continuous evolution following a differential equation. The proposed approach is based on refinement and proof using the Event-B method and the Rodin toolset. Two case studies borrowed from the literature are used to illustrate our approach. An assessment of the proposed approach is provided for evaluating its extensibility, effectiveness, scalability, and usability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","continuous and discrete models; CPS; Event-B; formal methods; hybrid systems; refinement and proof; Rodin IDE","Differential equations; Formal verification; Hybrid systems; Safety engineering; Correct-by-construction; Integrated development environment; Physical environments; Safety-critical domain; Sensors and actuators; Specification and designs; Verification of hybrid systems; Verification-and-validation; Embedded systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108022745"

Among different parts of human body, building the model of the hand can be a challenging task due to the posture deviations among collected scans. In this article, we proposed a posture invariant statistical shape model (SSM) of the human hand based on 59 3D scans of human hands. First, the 3D scans were spatially aligned using a Möbius sphere-based algorithm. An articulated skeleton, which contains 20 bone segments and 16 joints, was embedded for each 3D scan. Then, all scans were aligned to the same posture using the skeleton and the linear blend skinning (LBS) algorithm. Three methods, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA), kernel-PCA (KPCA) with different kernel functions, and independent component analysis (ICA), were evaluated in the construction of the SSMs regarding the compactness, the generalization ability, and the specificity. The PCA-based SSM was selected, where 20 principal components were used as parameters for the model. Results of the leave-one-out validation indicate that the proposed model was able to fit a given 3D scan of the human hand at an accuracy of 1.21 ± 0.14 mm. Experiment results also indicated that the proposed SSM outperforms the SSM that was built on the scans without posture correction. It is concluded that the proposed posture correction approach can effectively improve the accuracy of the hand SSM and therefore enables its wide usage in human-integrated digital twin applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Digital twin; Independent component analysis; Correction approaches; Digital representations; Generalization ability; High-fidelity; Independent component analysis(ICA); Kernel function; Principal Components; Statistical shape model; Musculoskeletal system","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107935225"

This holds for classical industries, for civil engineering, and for NDE and goes along with new business opportunities and models. Core components to enable those fourth revolutions are semantic interoperability, converting data into information, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) offering the possibility for every device, asset, or thing to communicate with each other using standard open interfaces, and the digital twin converting all the available information into knowledge and closing the cyber-physical loop. For NDE this concept can be used #1 to design, improve, and tailor the inspection system hard- and software and #2 to choose and adapt to best inspection solution for the customer or to enhance the inspection performance. Enabling better quality, speed, and cost at the same time.

In the paper, a method of cutting parameter optimization is presented on basis of the construction the digital twin of a CNC machine tool. In this method, an ontology on CNC machining process is established to be used as a communication bridge for understanding the semantic of the real-time interaction between the physical machine and the virtual twin.

However, there is still a lack of efficient methods for timely collection and analysis of collaborative networks. Therefore, an integrated framework consisting three parts, namely, system updating for data collection, data preprocessing, and social network analysis, is proposed for the twinning and mining of collaborative network of a construction project. First, a system updating strategy for automatic data collection is introduced. Centrality measures are then utilized to identify key players, including hubs and brokers. Meanwhile, information sharing frequency (ISF) and association rule mining are introduced to discover collaborative patterns, that is, frequently collaborating users (FCUs) and associations between information flows and task levels. Finally, the proposed framework is validated and demonstrated in a large-scale project. The results show that key players, FCUs, and associations between information flows and task levels were successfully discovered, providing a deep understanding of collaboration and communication for decision-making processes. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by: 1) introducing ISF and Apriori-based association mining algorithm to identify FCUs and information flow patterns in collaboration; 2) establishing a new data-driven framework to map and analyze fine-grained collaborative networks automatically. It is also shown that people tend to form small groups to handle certain levels or types of tasks more efficiently.

This article investigates the vulnerability of SoC estimation of BESSs in smart distribution networks (SDNs) to false data injection attacks (FDIAs) to provide a basis to study the attack mechanisms against BESSs and a theoretical guide to develop countermeasures. The mechanism of FDIAs against SoC estimation is investigated by theoretically analyzing the SoC estimation errors caused by compromised measurements, and a static FDIA model targeting one snapshot of SoC estimation is formulated. Considering temporal correlation among measurements, a detection method using the innovation test is proposed for static FDIAs, where the innovations are derived statistically. Considering the error accumulation effect, a novel sequential FDIA is proposed, which consists of a sequence of static FDIAs with small magnitudes. They can bypass most of the existing bad data detection algorithms, including the innovation test, with significant attack effects.

Currently, BIM models are commonly adopted to work with IoT-based systems and embrace smart technologies that offer interoperability in the communication layer. In future, it is envisioned that digital twins will provide new possibilities for cyber-physical systems via monitoring and simulation. However, rarely in this rapidly developing field is security fully considered. This paper reviews the relevant literature regarding the use of the IoT in the built environment and analyses current practices. It also presents examples of cities that use the IoT to improve construction and the lived experience. Finally, it reviews how digital twins factor in multiple layers defined in CPSs, from physical objects to information models. Based on this review, recommendations are provided documenting how BIM specifications can be expanded to become IoT compliant, enhancing standards to support cybersecurity, and ensuring digital twin and city standards can be fully integrated in future secure smart cities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BIM; Cybersecurity; Digital twins; IoT","Architectural design; Construction industry; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Information theory; Internet of things; Interoperability; Security of data; Smart city; Built environment; Communication layers; Current practices; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Fully integrated; Information models; Smart technology; Technological development; Digital twin","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105588737"

Industry 4.0 and digital transformation may increase productivity and reduce energy consumption. A digital twin (DT) is a key enabler in implementing Industry 4.0 in the areas of construction and smart cities. It is an emerging technology that connects different objects by utilising the advanced Internet of Things (IoT). As a technology, it is in high demand in various industries, and its literature is growing exponentially. Previous digital modeling practices, the use of data acquisition tools, human–computer–machine interfaces, programmable cities, and infrastructure, as well as Building Information Modeling (BIM), have provided digital data for construction, moni-toring, or controlling physical objects. However, a DT is supposed to offer much more than digital representation. Characteristics such as bi-directional data exchange and real-time self-management (e.g., self-awareness or self-optimisation) distinguish a DT from other information modeling sys-tems. The need to develop and implement DT is rising because it could be a core technology in many industrial sectors post-COVID-19. This paper aims to clarify the DT concept and differentiate it from other advanced 3D modeling technologies, digital shadows, and information systems. It also intends to review the state of play in DT development and offer research directions for future investigation. It recommends the development of DT applications that offer rapid and accurate data analysis platforms for real-time decisions, self-operation, and remote supervision requirements post-COVID-19. The discussion in this paper mainly focuses on the Smart City, Engineering and Construction (SCEC) sectors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Construc-tion; Cyber-physical; Deep learning; Digital shadow; Digital twin; Energy; Engineering; Intelligent construction 4.0; Internet of things; Sensor; Smart city","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104190401"

It purposes a construction method of the digital twin model of assembly interface contact characteristics, based on the interface virtual thin-layer element with nonuniform and replaceable attribute parameters. Firstly, the general framework of the digital twin model of assembly interface contact characteristics is given. Secondly, the typical assembly interface characteristics are analyzed. Aiming at the precise modeling of the assembly interface, the interface gradient virtual material thin-layer element is developed by integrating the measured data. Based on the surrogate model and genetic algorithm, the real-time assimilation and fusion of test data and simulation data are carried out. The thin-layer element parameters are optimized, and the dynamic updating of the assembly digital twin model is realized. Finally, the twin data model is applied to the dynamic performance analysis of the machining center and compared with the Takashi Yoshimura method. The results show that the analysis results of the twin data model are in good agreement with the test data, and the analysis accuracy is higher than that of the Takashi Yoshimura method, which verifies the feasibility of the digital twin model modeling method for assembly contact characteristics.

To be specific, IoT connects the physical and cyber world to capture real-time data for modeling and analyzing, and data mining methods incorporated in the virtual model aim to discover hidden knowledge in collected data. The proposed digital twin has been verified in a practical BIM-based project. Based on large inspection data from IoT devices, the 4D visualization and task-centered or worker-centered process model are built as the virtual model to simulate both the task execution and worker cooperation. Then, the high-fidelity virtual model is investigated by process mining and time series analysis. Results show that possible bottlenecks in the current process can be foreseen using the fuzzy miner, while the number of finished tasks in the next phase can be predicted by the multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMAX) model. Consequently, tactic decision-making can realize to not only prevent possible failure in advance, but also arrange work and staffing reasonably to make the process adapt to changeable conditions. In short, the significance of this paper is to build a data-driven digital twin framework integrating with BIM, IoT, and data mining for advanced project management, which can facilitate data communication and exploration to better understand, predict, and optimize the physical construction operations.

Therefore, CPSs and artificial intelligence are studied based on previous research to promote their use in the construction industry. Methods: The design scheme of a CPS-based indoor environment measurement and control system for intelligent buildings is based on four modules: detection, control, execution, and communication. An agent is utilized as the smallest control unit, and the multi-agent system (MAS) simulates the connections between human neurons to achieve autonomous and flexible access to information. Multi-agents are utilized to imitate the connections between human neurons. The physical world of the physics-based information fusion system is constructed. The basic concept of granular computing and the principle of granular formal concepts are analyzed to construct the information world of the CPS. The environmental information calculation module uses a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) for classification and pattern recognition. Results: After systematic testing and evaluation, it is found that the PSNR value, NRMSE value, and MAE value of the designed system are excellent, that is, the effectiveness and robustness of the system are high. The temperature control ability of the system is tested. The designed system is good at detecting temperatures and the corresponding situations, so the intelligent CPS can meet the indoor temperature response requirements. Conclusion: This research on the combination of a CPS and artificial intelligence in the construction industry can provide a theoretical basis and practical reference materials for the development of the intelligent construction industry. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agent; Artificial intelligence; Construction industry; Physics-based information fusion system","Autonomous agents; Backpropagation; Classification (of information); Construction industry; Information fusion; Intelligent buildings; Man machine systems; Multi agent systems; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Back-propagation neural networks; Environmental information; Indoor temperature; Intelligent constructions; Measurement and control systems; Physics-based information; Reference material; Systematic testing; Intelligent agents","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097753922"

In this article we examine a fundamental problem pertaining to the routing/dissemination of information, namely the construction of a backbone. We model an IoBT ad hoc network as a multilayer network and employ the concept of domination for multilayer networks which is a complete departure from the volume of earlier works, in order to select sets of nodes that will support the routing of information. Even though there is huge literature on similar topics during the past many years, the problem in military (IoBT) networks is quite different since these wireless networks are multilayer networks and treating them as a single (flat) network or treating each layer in isolation and calculating dominating set produces submoptimal or bad solutions; thus all the past literature which deals with single layer (flat) networks is in principle inappropriate. We design a new, distributed algorithm for calculating connected dominating sets which produces dominating sets of small cardinality. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on synthetic topologies, and compare it against the only two existing competitors.

In parallel, the research in Robotic Timber Construction (RTC) has evolved rapidly, focusing both on fabrication and assembly processes in order to improve the productivity of the construction industry and extend the production digital chain. This paper presents an original workflow for the automation from design to layered robotic assembly of reversible timber structures, aided by human-robot collaboration. An advanced digital design workflow for non-standard timber structures is established, shifting the focus towards the assembly of a kit of discrete wood elements into larger configurations that can be reconfigured in time. Linked to this, collaborative robots are employed for grasping, positioning and fixing of discrete timber elements, with the introduction of a multi-phase end effector that connects wood elements through reversible joinery. As such, the work introduces fundamental design and manufacturing concepts for an automated construction process that extends the material life cycle of wood, and consequently, its carbon store. The enhancement of robotic assembly is here achieved with the (1) integration of a feedback system based on location and force signals, and (2) human collaboration to provide immediate assistance to the robot in the case the signals do not match the defined assembly conditions. The various developments are applied to a research demonstrator which crystallizes the various design, constructional, and manufacturing inputs into a physical output, which is discussed from multiple viewpoints, in order to delineate relevant areas for future studies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Design automation; Digital twin; Human-robot collaboration; Layered assembly; Reversible structure; Robotic timber construction","Biofeedback; Carbon; Construction industry; End effectors; Industrial research; Industrial robots; Life cycle; Machine design; Manufacture; Robotics; Social robots; Timber; Wooden construction; Automated construction; Collaborative robots; Design and assemblies; Human-robot collaboration; Manufacturing concepts; Multiple viewpoints; Sustainable solution; Timber construction; Robotic assembly","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098473043"

Emerging processing technologies (high-pressure, pulsed electric fields, ohmic heating, ultrasound) and novel food systems (cultured biomass, 3-D bioprinting, cyber-physical chains) try to challenge the existing chains by developing potentially more nutritious and sustainable food solutions. However, new food systems rely on low technology readiness levels and estimation of their potential future benefits or drawbacks is a complex task mostly due to the lack of integrated data. The research is aimed for the development of conceptual guidelines of food production system structuring as cyber-physical systems. The study indicates that cyber-physical nature of modern food is a key for the engineering of more nutritious and sustainable paths for novel food systems. Implementation of machine learning methods for the collection, integration, and analysis of data associated with biomass production and processing on different levels from molecular to global, leads to the precise analysis of food systems and estimation of upscaling benefits, as well as possible negative rebound effects associated with societal attitude. Moreover, such data-integrated assessment systems allow transparency of chains, integration of nutritional and environmental properties, and construction of personalized nutrition technologies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyber-physical systems; Food chains; Food systems; Sustainability; Traceability","Agricultural robots; Bakeries; Canning; Cyber Physical System; Data integration; Electric fields; Embedded systems; Environmental technology; Food supply; Learning systems; Nutrition; Processed foods; Supply chains; Environmental property; Food processing technology; Food production systems; Integrated assessment; Machine learning methods; Processing technologies; Pulsed electric field; Technology readiness levels; Thermal processing (foods)","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089741122"

A challenge in the industry is that existing legacy data systems have been tailored independently to meet specific technical requirements, leading to disparate information systems that collectively provide a suboptimal foundation needed to support a modern digital environment. To address this challenge, a detailed study was conducted in partnership with Network Rail to test a method that was adapted for the industry to identify appropriate, relevant and effective asset information requirements (AIRs). A robust library of AIRs will determine what data the organisation should be collecting and why these are necessary through design, construction, operation and disposal, hence informing the information requirements of a DT. The methodology was modified with four adaptations to improve its compatibility with the industry and was tested with 24 subject matter experts in the rail sector. It was concluded that integration of the AIR method would ensure that the rail industry is well positioned for digital transformation and provides a solid foundation to develop a DT. However, industry integration of the method would be a significant undertaking due to the amount of information that needs to be considered throughout the process, and so further research is required to improve its scalability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Building Information Modelling (BIM); data; digital twin","Architectural design; Building information modeling; Building Information Modelling; Data; Data systems; Digital environment; Industry case studies; Information requirement; Legacy data; Rail industry; Technical requirement; Legacy systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125222957"

A primary motivation for ‘getting things right’ in these early design stages is that altering the design is significantly less costly and more effective than when hardware and software have already been developed. Engineering cyber-physical systems requires the construction of several different types of models, each representing a different view, which include stakeholder requirements, system behavior, and the system architecture. Furthermore, each of these models can be represented at different levels of abstraction. Formal reasoning has improved the precision and expanded the available types of analysis in assuring correctness of requirements, behaviors, and architectures. However, each is usually modeled in distinct formalisms and corresponding tools. Currently, this disparity means that a system designer must manually check that the different models are in agreement. Manually editing and checking models is error prone, time consuming, and sensitive to any changes in the design of the models themselves. Wiring diagrams and related theory provide a means for formally organizing these different but related modeling views, resulting in a compositional modeling language for cyber-physical systems. Such a categorical language can make concrete the relationship between different model views, thereby managing complexity, allowing hierarchical decomposition of system models, and formally proving consistency between models. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Categorical language; Compositional modeling; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Early design stages; Hardware and software; Hierarchical decompositions; Levels of abstraction; System architectures; Modeling languages","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101227934"

In this regard, in this article, the principles and methods of integrating BIM and DT technologies within the framework of the so-called “Factories of the Future” (FoF) are formulated. Wherein the physical twin of FoF includes both production technologies and production infrastructure with buildings, structures and systems included in it, while particular attention is given to Operation and Maintenances (O&M) stage of object lifecycle which is less developed in comparison with design and creation stages. In addition, this paper also considers the role of systems information modeling (SIM) in such objects.

To begin with, a scientometric review is performed to explore the characteristics of keywords, journals, and clusters based on 4,473 journal articles published in 1997–2020. It is found that there has been an explosion of relevant papers especially in the past 10 years along with the change in keyword popularity from expert systems to building information modeling (BIM), digital twins, and others. Then, a brief understanding of CEM is provided, which can be benefited from the emerging trend of AI in terms of automation, risk mitigation, high efficiency, digitalization, and computer vision. Special concerns have been put on six hot research topics that amply the advantage of AI in CEM, including (1) knowledge representation and reasoning, (2) information fusion, (3) computer vision, (4) natural language processing, (5) intelligence optimization, and (6) process mining. The goal of these topics is to model, predict, and optimize issues in a data-driven manner throughout the whole lifecycle of the actual complex project. To further narrow the gap between AI and CEM, six key directions of future researches, such as smart robotics, cloud virtual and augmented reality (cloud VR/AR), Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), digital twins, 4D printing, and blockchains, are highlighted to constantly facilitate the automation and intelligence in CEM. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Construction engineering and management; Critical review","Architectural design; Augmented reality; Computational electromagnetics; Computer vision; Data mining; Expert systems; Intelligent robots; Knowledge representation; Life cycle; Natural language processing systems; Building Information Model - BIM; Construction engineering; Digital transformation; Hot research topics; Knowledge representation and reasoning; NAtural language processing; Qualitative analysis; Virtual and augmented reality; Digital twin","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097906264"

Key external facets addressed are the establishment of metrics that adequately measure MFOP performance as a stochastic process, optimization of the recovery period through a systems approach, transition to risk-based maintenance using high fidelity diagnostic and prognostic systems, establishment of an architecture to facilitate quality data consumed by a digital twin, and construction of maintenance policies suited for MFOP.

Analyzing energy demand rates facilitates the adoption of efficient energy management solutions. Moreover, forecasting future energy demand is needed to support decision makers in long-term strategic planning. Hence, energy consumption prediction using Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes an important research field recently. However, forecasting models need to be trained on rich data to provide precise predictions. It sometimes can be difficult as irregularities could have very low frequency in the data. Therefore, this research paper proposes an innovative data construction framework to enhance the performance of Al-based energy demand forecasting solutions using Digital Twin Technology (DT). Nowadays, DT becomes an emerging technology in the industrial and energy sectors. In this research study, DT technology is utilized in constructing an extensive dataset that covers various scenarios to train AI models.

To solve the problems of low assembly efficiency and the inability to fully reflect the assembly process indexes and product characteristics in the traditional construction machinery arm assembly, this paper studies assembly process modeling and simulation for the construction machinery arm based on assembly sensing data and digital twin. By extracting and processing the assembly resource data and field measurement data of the machinery arm, the assembly process information database under the digital twin environment is constructed, which lays the foundation for the virtual assembly model construction of the machinery arm. Through the real-time data interaction between virtual space and physical space, a complete assembly of digital twin spaces is formed. Finally, taking the assembly line of an excavator armed as an example, it is shown that the digital twin-based assembly simulation can monitor the assembly process in real-time and optimize its configuration to improve assembly efficiency. Therefore, an effective closed-loop feedback mechanism is constructed for the whole assembly process of the construction machinery arm. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","assembly simulation; construction machinery arm; data interaction; digital twin; excavator; sensing data","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145370582"

The testing and validation of CPS software are seriously affected by the cognitive level of individual testers, thus the quality of testing is difficult to guarantee. We believe that the knowledge reuse technology can address this problem to some extent. To achieve that, a construction method of CPS testing knowledge graph was carried out by our team, and the domain ontology of knowledge graph was organized and illustrated. After that, the key technologies such as automatic data extraction and intelligent retrieval were researched. Finally, a test data reuse approach based on knowledge graph was designed. With this approach, we expect to achieve the goal of turning the isolated island of test data into the semantic net of knowledge. Furthermore, increasing the reusability of test knowledge and reducing the defect omissions caused by cognitive deficiency of testers.

Dur ing this hydration reaction, the system develops strength due to the formation of various solid hydration phases over time. In the case of ordinary Portland cements (OPC), the main hydration phase is called C-S-H phase, and is responsible for the early- and long-term strength development of cement. Therefore, the formation of this phase determines the time for continuing construction work, e.g. removing formwork or concreting of the following structures. Under laboratory conditions and for relatively small samples, methods such as quantitative X-ray diffraction analysis are able to monitor the progress of hydration over time. However, it is more challenging to monitor the hydration of larger structures under non-laboratory conditions. In this study, we propose a sensitive and robust monitoring method to detect and quantify the formation of various hydration phases during the early hydration of OPC using Coda Wave Interferometry, based on the evaluation of ultrasonic waves with embedded piezoelectric sensors. We investigated the signal correlation and velocity perturbation of ultrasonic signals during the first 24 hours of OPC hydration. We identified periods during which these parameters varied significantly and periods during which the signals stabilized, in our case approximately 18 hours after initiation of the reaction. Simultaneously, we monitored the hydration of OPC using similar but smaller samples by means of heat flow calorimetry and a Vicat penetration test. We predicted the evolution of the main hydration phases’ mass by thermodynamic modeling and validated our results as well as the assignment of characteristic periods to the formation of specific hydration phases in the time domain. Our proposed method adds to the spectrum of ultrasound-based methods for hydration monitoring. Our approach aims at a more sophisticated prediction of the early-age strength development of cement and concrete, even under site conditions and for large structures. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Binders; Concretes; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Hydration; Interferometry; Structural health monitoring; X ray powder diffraction; Building process; Cement hydration; Coda waves; Complex mechanisms; Hydraulic binders; Laboratory conditions; Large structures; Ordinary Portland cement; Strength development; Wave interferometry; Portland cement","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139267669"

Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the design, construction, monitoring, and maintenance of the infrastructures and the cooperation of several stakeholders throughout their lifetime, it is indispensable to introduce a comprehensive platform for the digital representation of infrastructures. Although the DT emphasizes the role of digital modeling and data analysis, there is a gap between physical modeling and data-driven tools. The newly introduced Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are capable of not only filling this gap but also representing a unified real-time platform for different users from various fields. These algorithms suggest an agile environment for users to introduce different criteria from the design stage to the health monitoring period. The PINN integrates both physical modeling and data analysis in a unique algorithm, helping them interact simultaneously and providing real-time, reliable responses. By means of the PINN, the DT can learn and update the model from various data sources with a unique platform, which plays an essential role in the rapid flow of information and transparency of data-based calculations. The dynamic ambiance of the PINN enables the users to interact with the modeling procedure and track the analysis. In this study, the details of the proposed platform for the integration of the PINNs in the DT are addressed for monitoring the bridges. Extensive numerical studies are provided for various scenarios of sensor equipment, including sensor type, data accuracy, and installation pattern. The performance of the proposed platform is evaluated for predicting subsequent responses to ensure the reliability of the responses in future decision makings. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bridges; Digital Twin; Health Monitoring; Physics Informed Neural Networks","Cyber Physical System; Data handling; Embedded systems; Information analysis; Structural health monitoring; Construction monitoring; Design construction; Digital datas; Digital modeling; Digital representations; Health monitoring; Neural-networks; Physic informed neural network; Physical data; Physical modelling; Decision making","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139236074"

However, it is a tedious work to collect IS and IE data along grid lines covering a large target area for characterization of subsurface defects. On the other hand, data processing is very complicated that requires domain experts to interpret the results. To address the above problems, we present a novel robotic inspection system named as Impact-Rover to automate the data collection process and introduce data analytics software to visualize the inspection result allowing regular non-professional people to understand. The system consists of three modules: 1) a robotic platform with vertical mobility to collect IS and IE data in hard-to-reach locations, 2) vision-based positioning module that fuses the RGB-D camera, IMU and wheel encoder to estimate the 6-DOF pose of the robot, 3) a data analytics software module for processing the IS data to generate defect maps. The Impact-Rover hosts both IE and IS devices on a sliding mechanism and can perform move-stop-sample operations to collect multiple IS and IE data at adjustable spacing. The robot takes samples much faster than the manual data collection method because it automatically takes the multiple measurements along a straight line and records the locations. This paper focuses on reporting experimental results on IS. We calculate features and use unsupervised learning methods for analyzing the data. By combining the pose generated by our vision-based localization module and the position of the head of the sliding mechanism we can generate maps of possible defects. The results on concrete slabs demonstrate that our impact-sounding system can effectively reveal shallow defects. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Concrete slabs; Cyber Physical System; Data acquisition; Data handling; Defects; Embedded systems; Fracture mechanics; Inspection; Learning systems; Nondestructive examination; Robotics; Structural health monitoring; Unsupervised learning; Data analytics; Domain experts; Echo data; Grid line; Impact echo; Non-destructive evaluation methods; Robotic inspection; Robotic inspection system; Sliding mechanism; Subsurface defect; Data Analytics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139222501"

Traditional manual inspection highly relies on experiences and subjective judgments of human operators and conducting sieving tests is not real-time and energy-consuming. Rock fragments in real-world images are often observed against a dark background, distributed with high size diversity, complicatedly distributed, and blocked by each other. To solve these problems, this study proposes a novel instance segmentation-based method for on-site rock fragments recognition. The proposed instance segmentation model includes two subnetworks: object detection and semantic segmentation. The results show that 88% of rock fragments can be recognized, and the average recall and average IoU values reach 0.85 and 0.75 on the 15 test images, respectively. Besides, both small and large rock fragments can be recognized well.

Most of the existing SHM systems rely on a large number of point sensors attached to or embedded inside the structures. The sensor network should be densely distributed on the structure or around the potential damage areas for an acceptable damage detection performance. Apparently, this is not an optimal solution for an effective cost. On the other hand, issues such as securing a reliable power supply, cable connections and maintenance costs have remained a major challenge for current distributed SHM systems.

The main attention is focused on the description of singular processes in incoming data flows: Topological singularities, strong asingularities, singular probability measures. On the basis of topological analysis and double microlocal analysis, predictors for the appearance of all types of singularities and their interconnection were determined. The singularity progression timeline is constructed. It is shown that the singularity progression timeline predicts the occurrence of predictors of failure. That is, they are hidden predictors and the cause of failure predictors. Based on the analysis performed, the traditional version of the Failure progression timeline (FPTL) is corrected. In particular, transient classes are defined between the FPTL classes. In this case, the classes of transient processes are determined by the birth and evolution of singularities, and on the transient process, its own progression timeline of singularities is also determined. The problem of calculating remaining useful life is discussed. Non-temporary characteristics of time series are introduced, reflecting the degree of proximity of the system to class boundaries and failure boundaries.

Moreover, the integration of BIM and GIS has been proven to improve collaboration among stakeholders by allowing them to visualize information seamlessly between buildings and their surroundings. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, many undergraduate and graduate courses were moved online, which posed many challenges on instructors to deliver lectures in accessible and informative ways. Furthermore, many courses and curricula have been originally online and have not yet benefited from the full potential of MR in virtual classrooms. Therefore, the aim of this research is to evaluate how MR applications of integrated BIM-GIS can improve the online learning experience of construction management students.

However, current developments related to building DTs are at an early stage in the building life cycle, especially regarding integrating and analyzing asset and facility management technologies. This study presents a novel holistic system to construct a building-level DT integrating BIM data in the building life cycle from a multi-stakeholder perspective. First, current challenges faced by stakeholders are documented and analyzed by a requirement model. Then, a multilayered framework is proposed to underpin the complex requirements when tackling the challenges. This framework assists five major areas of asset and facility management: space, energy, operation, safety, and maintenance. A web-based system based on the proposed framework is developed and visualized through a game engine in a case study for a commercial building in China.

More importantly, construction jobsites are classified among the most vulnerable environments to severe wind events. During hurricanes, unsecured and incomplete elements of construction sites, such as scaffolding, plywood, and metal rods, will become the potential wind-borne debris, causing cascading damages to the construction projects and the neighboring communities. Thus, it is no wonder that construction firms implement jobsite emergency plans to enforce preparedness responses before extreme weather events. However, relying on checklist-based emergency action plans to carry out a thorough hurricane preparedness is challenging in large-scale and complex site environments. For enabling systematic responses for hurricane preparedness, we have proposed a vision-based technique to identify and analyze the potential wind-borne debris in construction jobsites. Building on this, this paper demonstrates the fidelity of a new machine vision-based method to support construction site hurricane preparedness and further discuss its implications. The outcomes indicate that the convenience of visual data collection and the advantages of the machine vision-based frameworks enable rapid scene understanding and thus provide critical heads up for practitioners to recognize and localize the potential wind-borne debris in construction jobsites and effectively implement hurricane preparedness. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Computer vision; Construction industry; Disasters; Hurricanes; Scaffolds; Semantics; Classifieds; Construction jobsite; Construction sites; Hurricane preparedness; Job sites; Machine-vision; Natural disasters; Vision based; Vulnerable environments; Wind events; Debris","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132566126"

Several hazards exist when workers are within the robots' working envelope, including high mental stress induced by the robot as well as the risk of physical collision. To mitigate these risks, this study proposes a cyber-physical system (CPS) for safe, worker-centered human-robot collaboration (HRC). The physical components of the CPS include a wearable biosensor for assessing workers' mental conditions and a video camera for evaluating the risk of collision accidents. The cyber component incorporates a machine learning layer that employs a kernelized logistic regression to translate worker bio-signals into distinct physiological states. Simultaneously, the system monitors the relative distance between workers and robots by applying computer vision techniques (i.e., video frame differencing, dilation, and contour detection). To test the feasibility of the proposed CPS, six subjects were asked to perform a series of bricklaying tasks jointly with a vehicle robot with different risks of collision (various distances from the robot) and at different levels of cognitive load (various tasks' complexity). The findings revealed that the proposed CPS allows the co-bot to adjust its speed relative to the subject's physiological states with 93.70% accuracy. In addition, the proposed system shows promising performance in collision avoidance with the accurate monitoring of position between robots and humans. The results unfold the feasibility of the proposed CPS in enhancing safe and intelligent HRC in construction under the trend of Industry 4.0. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Embedded systems; Occupational risks; Risk assessment; Robots; Video cameras; Construction sites; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Efficient implementation; Human-robot collaboration; Mental stress; Physiological state; Robots working; Stress-induced; Workers'; Cyber Physical System","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132551865"

However, there are limitations for construction managers to monitor robotic construction processes. This is due to the lack of well-developed human-robot collaboration interfaces. Digital Twin (DT) and Mixed Reality (MR) are two emerging technologies that can help to address these limitations by enhancing human-robot interaction, for on-site construction processes. However, DT in MR for human-robot interactions in robotic construction processes has not yet been widely studied in research or in practice. This work explores effective human-robot collaboration for automated construction processes using on-site real-time DT of robotic process in a MR construction environment. First, a DT prototype of a robotic construction process establishes a two-way communication between the physical and virtual models of the robot arm. Next, real-time process data is collected from the robot and sent to the visualisation and database platforms. This work describes the workflow in order to send the real-time data to the MR headset for direct visual feedback and direct interaction with the robot arm. The prototype is validated using a case study demonstration of a robotic masonry construction process. By demonstrating this proof of concept for real-time DT of robotic construction processes in MR, this work contributes to construction management for digital fabrication through human-robot collaboration.

The concept is based on the craftsman controlled instructive interaction between a High Level of Automation (robotic) fabrication setup and a human co-worker. It argues that by enabling the craftsmen to coordinate or take over specific process parts, a significant increase in flexibility and robustness of automated workflows becomes feasible. This is highly relevant within the project-based construction industry where efficient and flexible production of one-off components is predominant. A novel approach to integrate human and robotic co-workers in a joint fabrication setup that we call “Instructive Human Robot Collaboration” is introduced. With Vizor, a computational framework was developed for this purpose. It provides an intuitive interface between human and robotic fabrication units via a mixed reality head-mounted display (HMD). Finally, the proposed method is tested with an initial case study in which a 14-Axis fabrication setup is connected with human craft. The HMD gives a craftsman without any knowledge in robot programming direct control over the fabrication setup and extends its individual skill set. Fabrication tasks can be shared freely and between human and robotic units, enabling a dynamically adaptive workflow. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Augmented reality; Digital Twin; instructive Human-robot collaboration; project-based, Task-Skill comparison","Augmented reality; Construction industry; Helmet mounted displays; Mixed reality; Robot programming; Robotics; Robots; Building construction; Human-robot collaboration; In-buildings; Instructive human-robot collaboration; Project-based; Project-based, task-skill comparison; Robotic fabrications; Task sharing; Task skill; Workers'; Fabrication","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127600972"

They currently provide human users at all levels of an organisation, access to relevant digital representations of job-critical information at various lifecycle modes, from asset design through to asset maintenance. However, existing solutions lack the real-time functionality, suitable model resolution and machine interfaces which open the door to realising operational improvements from these models. This work proposes a method and proof of concept that enables high-fidelity, real-time 3D modelling of asset construction phase operations using Photogrammetry, Terrain Deformation and Plant Telematics / IoT. This will create a digital twin to act as a platform to facilitate machine automation, which is imperative to catalyse and drive adoption of automation and autonomy in construction.

Emerging technologies such as Augmented Reality and Digital Twins have recently gained momentum in the electrical construction industry. While these emerging technologies provide a novice approach to visualizing construction work, most of their use-cases are based on Building Information Modelling (BIM). Therefore, to unlock the full potential of emerging technologies, it is important to properly allocate and leverage BIM resources on a construction project. Therefore, this research aims to provide electrical contractors with a set of tools to understand and leverage their BIM resources before and during construction. To achieve the research objective, a survey was developed, and 23 complete responses were collected to identify factors that impact the actual percentage of electrical contractors’ BIM Efforts. The survey results were augmented with follow-up structured interviews with subject matter experts having electrical and BIM experience. BIM practices collected from the interviews were grouped into three categories: people, process, and technology.

Creating, editing, storing, and sharing information in digital environments is only one side of the coin; the other involves monitoring and controlling physical processes on construction sites. Given the nature of construction sites, where humans and machines/equipment work collaboratively, safety concerns arise. Utilizing interconnected and cyber-physical systems such as (semi)autonomous and remote-controlled machines on-site magnifies the importance of robust cybersecurity. Therefore, it becomes necessary to understand the threats against each networked equipment, analyze the vulnerabilities, assess the risks, and provide mitigation methods. Cybersecurity frameworks are effective solutions for this purpose; however, they are usually generic and thus require customization to be employed in the construction site environment. Against this background, this paper reviews existing cybersecurity frameworks/standards and selects the most suitable one to implement in the construction environment. The implementation was performed by customizing the selected generic framework considering the needs of a hypothetical construction site that utilizes autonomous earthmoving equipment. For the evaluation, a scoring system that was not included in the original framework was proposed. Given the paucity of studies in this field and lack of cybersecurity awareness in the construction industry, this study aims (1) to raise awareness about the potential cyber threats against construction sites that are increasingly interconnected, (2) to point out the need for a customized cyber assessment method on-site, and (3) help building a security-minded approach within the construction industry. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autonomous Earthmoving Equipment; Construction 4.0; Cyber-Physical Systems; Cybersecurity; Cybersecurity Frameworks; Vulnerability Assessment","Construction; Construction equipment; Embedded systems; Process control; Remote control; Risk assessment; Robotics; Autonomous earthmoving equipment; Construction 4.0; Construction sites; Cyber security; Cybersecurity framework; Digital environment; Operational technologies; Sharing information; Vulnerability assessments; Construction industry","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127559052"

The degree of automation in this area is low. Caused by the great variability of construction projects and building components, automation systems that can adapt flexibly to different construction projects are required. However, a system that fulfills these conditions does not yet exist. Down-times for reconfiguration in between projects must be short. The use of robotics for the automation of prefabrication is constantly developing. Recent publications present a novel, flexible, reconfigurable, and transportable manufacturing platform using industrial robots. A system consisting of several of these modular platforms can be flexibly adapted to the changing requirements of different construction projects and set up on-site at local timber construction companies. To ensure the manufacturability of the timber components and to minimize downtimes between projects, the entire workflow from digital design to fabrication must be considered. The co-design approach makes this possible. It breaks up the currently existing sequential process from design to fabrication and considers all sub-steps holistically. Thus, enabling the consideration of the fabrication capabilities during building design. This allows the planning of building components and system layout so that fabrication is feasible. To achieve this, the fabricability of a given system layout has to be evaluated. This requires a digital twin of the fabrication system as a simulation model. The reconfigurability of the fabrication system must be reflected by the digital twin. The fabrication tasks and the system configuration are constantly changed in search of a valid combination. Therefore, with each iteration, the digital twin must be adapted or newly created. At present, this is mostly a manual process. This makes the whole approach unfeasible. To solve this problem, this work presents an approach for the automated, model-based generation of digital twins for the simulation of reconfigurable fabrication systems for timber prefabrication. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyber-Physical System; Digital Twin; Simulation; Software Defined Manufacturing; Timber Prefabrication","Architectural design; Computer software; Construction; Construction industry; Cyber Physical System; Fabrication; Robotics; Timber; Automatic Generation; Construction projects; Fabrication systems; Modeling for simulations; Reconfigurable; Simulation; Software defined manufacturing; System layout; Timber construction; Timber prefabrication; Embedded systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127550647"

Coordinating the layout, delivery, and placement of these embeds is a sensitive construction chore, one that if not done properly, can lead to considerable lost productivity, delayed schedules, and cost overruns. This coordination is further complicated by the fact that most embeds are installed in the project by one trade contractor to be used by an entirely different trade contractor later in the project. As a result, the construction manager undertakes routine inspections to minimize future complications if those embeds are missed or incorrectly placed. Therefore, it is crucial that the inspection process is as complete as possible to ensure a project’s success. The construction industry is also shifting to a digital twin approach in the management of the construction process whereby parametric models are finding more use in the inspection process. Coupling this technology with augmented reality (AR) allows inspectors to use BIMs in unique and more informative ways. In this paper the researchers examine three different inspection processes, a traditional 2-dimensional paper inspection, an AR + BIM inspection, and an AR + BIM inspection with interactive queues. Quantitative data were collected with each method along with qualitative feedback from the participants to gauge perceived effectiveness of their inspection. Among the three methods, it was evident that the use of AR improved through its development. However, from the qualitative feedback, it was discovered that some visuals in the AR assisted inspection were distracting, leading the researcher to conclude that visual elements in AR can affect the inspection outcomes. Furthermore, the researchers discuss recommendations for using AR + BIM for embed inspections in the context of using assistive technology for that process. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Augmented Reality; Construction Quality; Inspections; Productivity","Architectural design; Commerce; Concretes; Construction industry; Contractors; Inspection; Productivity; Robotics; Assistive; Comparative analyzes; Construction manager; Construction process; Construction quality; Cost-overruns; Inspection process; Lost productivities; Qualitative feedback; Routine inspection; Augmented reality","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127541574"

The construction of large-scale city-level 3D model will become another important medium after images and videos. We propose an autonomous approach to reconstruct the voxel model of the scene in real-time, and estimate the best set of viewing angles according to the precision requirement. These task views are assigned to the drones based on Optimal Mass Transport (OMT) optimization. In this process, the multi-level pipelining in the chip design method is applied to accelerate the parallelism between exploration and data acquisition. Our method includes: (1) real-time perception and reconstruction of scene voxel model and obstacle avoidance; (2) determining the best observation and viewing angles of scene geometry through global and local optimization; (3) assigning the task views to the drones and planning path based on the OMT optimization, and iterating continuously according to new exploration results; (4) expediting exploration and data acquisition in parallel through multi-stage pipeline to improve efficiency. Our method can schedule routes for drones according to the scene and its optimal acquisition perspective in real-time, which avoids the model void and lack of accuracy caused by traditional aerial 3D scanning using routes of cultivating land regardless of the object, and lays a solid foundation for the 3D real-life model to directly become the available 3D data source for AR and VR. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method by collecting several groups of large-scale city-level data.

DTs make full use of both historical knowledge and of streaming data from sensors. DTs have been given numerous (distinct) definitions and descriptions in the literature. There is no consensus on terminology, nor a comprehensive description of workflows nor architectures. Following Multi-Paradigm Modelling principles, this paper proposes to explicitly model construction and use workflows of DTs as well as their architectures. We apply the concepts of variability (also known as product family) modeling, in particular to DT workflow and architecture. This allows for the de-/re-construction of the different DT variants in a principled, reproducible and partially automatable manner. To illustrate our ideas, two small use cases are discussed: a line-following robot (representative for an Automated Guided Vehicle) and an incubator (representative for an Industrial Convection Oven). The use cases focus on important systems in an industrial context. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Architecture; Digital Model; Digital Shadow; Digital Twin; Variability Modeling; Workflow","Architecture; Computer vision; Complex engineered systems; Digital modeling; Digital shadow; Modeling principles; Multiparadigm models; NOR architecture; Optimization analysis; Streaming data; Variability modeling; Work-flows; Automatic guided vehicles","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125194285"

Assurance cases are one widely used tool for presenting an argument in support of system safety requirements backed by a body of evidence - e.g., test data, formal analysis, or expert review. A system assurance case should regularly evolve during the development process as the system design is refined, but construction and refinement of the assurance argument is a labor-intensive and error-prone process. Reuse of common patterns from successful arguments is one prominent technique for reducing the required effort, but instantiation of these patterns still requires manual compilation and organization of the relevant information from system artifacts. Since model-based engineering techniques are common for CPS development, the relevant information is often contained in a set of interconnected models describing the system. In this paper, we present a method for assurance case construction based on the instantiation and composition of patterns. This method automates the collection and organization of necessary information by extracting it directly from an existing set of system design models. To support human review and refinement, the generated assurance case maintains (1) traceability from objects in the argument back to the corresponding system models and (2) explain ability of choices made during the construction process based on the relationships between model objects. An illustrative example is provided which demonstrates the utility of this method to produce assurance cases which are tightly integrated with source artifacts while requiring significantly less effort than the manual construction alternative. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","assurance case; automated method; model based engineering; system assurance","Embedded systems; Safety engineering; Assurance case; Automated methods; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Design models; Mission critical applications; Model-based engineering; Safe operation; Safety critical applications; Systems assurance; Systems analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124971477"

Such solutions have been tested many times on real devices in various natural environments. The construction of models using the program code allows us to understand stable architectural solutions, present them in a graphical form and take a look at the proper organization. While UML models are suitable to represent relations between classes and show software design patterns, to create reliable software for CPS one should study patterns on the organization such systems that take into account both software and hardware parts. AADL (Architecture Analysis Design Language) aims to establish clear, generally accepted semantics to express architectural models of interconnected hardware components as well as system software structure. U sing the semantics, we can easily obtain graphical representations of the models to apply in the hardware design process. Also, having a formal architectural description, we can validate some valuable system properties. In this paper, we create extended models for hardware parts and software components of a cheap reprogrammable controller for RC-based DIY systems based on the ArduPilot Mega board. The models are fully based on the actual open-source code, existing sample models and reference datasheets.

Dividing activities into actions helps to further conceptualize motion models for predicting what a human intends to do in a hybrid work system. However, it is not straightforward to identify human intentions in collaborative operations for robots to understand and collaborate. This paper presents a concept for semantic representation of human actions and intention prediction using a flexible task ontology interface in the semantic data hub stored in a domain knowledge base. This semantic data hub enables the construction of a DT with corresponding reasoning and simulation algorithms. Furthermore, a knowledge-based DT concept is used to analyze and verify the presented use-case of Human-Robot Collaboration in assembly operations. The preliminary evaluation showed a promising reduction of time for assembly tasks, which identifies the potential to i) improve efficiency reflected by reducing costs and errors and ultimately ii) assist human workers in improving decision making.

The built buildings perform poorly in terms of energy usage and energy conservation. The study expects to explore the potential safety hazards of prefabricated buildings during the construction process. On this basis, a modelling study of the construction process is carried out. The study uses Digital Twins (DTs) technology and prefabricated Building Information Modelling (BIM) to conduct in-depth modelling research on the building construction process. The prefabricated building construction system oriented to DTs technology can well solve the problems of structural damage and deformation in the production, transportation, and assembly process of building components. Especially in prefabricated buildings, it can monitor and accurately predict the damage of building components that may occur in the entire system due to structural problems and material problems in real time. Regarding the building information model, the study uses third-party software to transfer the assembly information to the network cloud to further realize the display of the BIM. The study shows that the maximum value of the effective risk cases selected is 130, and its effective rate is 100%; after processing the data, it is found that the initial value is always stable, and its value is 1; the extracted value is always changing, the maximum value is 0.86, and the minimum is 0.75. By this result, the conclusion is that DTs technology and BIM can effectively monitor the indicators of risk problems during the construction of prefabricated buildings and can further reduce potential safety hazards.

In this paper, we focus on one of such methodologies, implemented in the QKS tool, which is able to explicitly take into account the specification of the discretization of the state space due to analog-todigital conversion. Controllers output by QKS are able to drive any controllable state inside the system goal. However, such controllers may allow a goal state to go outside the goal region, in order to be able to bring it back into the goal region later. QKS does not provide any means to detect such behavior. Here we propose to modify QKS in order to provide an additional feature, which only outputs stabilizing controllers, i.e., controllers which never allow goal states to go outside the goal region. If this is not possible for the input system, an empty controller is returned. We prove the feasibility of our approach on well-known control theory case studies, namely the multi input buck DC-DC converter and the inverted pendulum. Our experimental results show that we are able to output stabilizing controllers using limited additional resources with respect to the original QKS. c 2021 © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automatic controller synthesis; Cps; Stabilizing controllers","Control system synthesis; Cyber Physical System; DC-DC converters; Embedded systems; Hybrid systems; Linear systems; Safety engineering; Automatic controller synthesis; Automatic controllers; Automatic synthesis; Controller synthesis; Correct-by-construction; Cps; Discrete time; Discretizations; Linear hybrid systems; Stabilizing controllers; Controllers","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122657665"

This allows to make correct implementation of time-aware systems and significantly simplify the construction of models for verification and simulation, as well as ensure fairness of the model and determinism of the function block system execution at a resource level. The model formalism is based on a well-known abstract state machines (ASM) notion, which can be used as an intermediate formal representation to generate a variety of models for different purposes, e.g. formal verification, and executable code. This paper exemplifies this approach by the generation of models in the SMV language.

The process of magnesium twin roll casting makes this possible by combining several different process steps into one process. However, due to the harsh process conditions, it is not possible to directly record the relevant process parameters to control product properties. Therefore, in this article will be discussed, how twin roll casting process can be transformed into a property-controlled process with a soft sensor. The digital image of the process is created by usage of an extended layer model, developed as a digital twin for offline computation and whose calculation times are many times shorter than in the FEM method. This makes it possible to train the digital twin and use it for online controlling in the TRC process. As a result, from the sensor data on the roller surface, which in turn forms the computational core of the required soft sensor, conclusions can be drawn about the state of the material in the rolling gap. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin; Layer model; Soft sensor; Twin roll casting","Magnesium castings; Magnesium printing plates; Process control; Casting process; Layer model; Light-weight constructions; Magnesium sheets; Preparation of papers; Process condition; Process steps; Sensor control; Soft sensors; Twin roll casting; Magnesium alloys","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120907959"

Artificial neural network (ANN), a widely used data-driven model, can accurately identify nonlinear relationships in the water environment. In this paper, a recognition model for black-odorous water bodies based on ANN was established to directly identify the sensory description of water bodies. This study used water quality data and sensory description (color and odor) as samples to train backpropagation (BP) neural networks. The training results show that the accuracy of the color and odor models reaches 86.7% and 85.8%, respectively. It can thus be suggested that the sensory description can be accurately recognized by BP neural network. The application results indicate that all seven rivers had black-odorous phenomenon within a year. The recognition models have been instrumental in water resource management. Meanwhile, the models provide a reference for the evaluation and early warning of black-odorous water bodies in other regions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120426142"

However, training scenarios in most of the existing VR games lack complex tasks and the realistic environment required for actual construction. This work proposes a conceptual framework for dynamically updating VR training games through information streaming from the digital twins. The training scenarios in VR games are automatically created from the project intent information, project status knowledge, safety regulations, and historical knowledge provided by the digital twins. Therefore, construction workers can be trained in realistic training environments with relevant tasks they soon afterwards pursue. Dynamic VR training is expected mutually beneficial for enhanced digital twins and periodic construction safety management.

Consequently, we introduce a KG modularization framework based on the well-established RAMI 4.0 architecture model. A key benefit of the proposed approach is that the resulting KGs support navigation across abstraction hierarchies, enabling bottom-up contextualization of raw data on the one hand, and top-down explanations by linking to lower levels of granularity on the other hand.

Given that the method is intended for real-scale structures, such as bridges, the work can be divided to 3 steps: (1) to segment and extract geometric information for structural components; (2) to convert the geometry information to FE mesh with consideration of element types; (3) to assign material property as well as boundary conditions based on extracted components type.

There is a need for comprehensive diagnostic tools that help engineers identify faults, both during development and after deployment. This article presents the software architecture for an agent-based fault diagnostic engine that equips agents with domain-knowledge of IEC 61499. The engine encourages a Model-Driven Development with Diagnostics methodology where agents work alongside engineers during iterative cycles of design, development, diagnosis and refinement. Attribute-Driven Design (ADD) was used to propose the architecture to capture fault telemetry directly from the ICPS. A Views and Beyond Software Architecture Document presents the architecture. The Architecturally-Significant Requirement (ASRs) were used to design the views while an Architectural Trade-off Analysis Method (ATAM) evaluated critical parts of the architecture. The agents locate faults during both early-stage development and later provide long-term fault management. The architecture introduces dynamic, low-latency software-in-loop Diagnostic Points (DPs) that operate under the control of an agent to capture fault telemetry. Using sound architectural design approaches and documentation methods, coupled with rigorous evaluation and prototyping, the article demonstrates how quality attributes, risks and architectural trade-offs were identified and mitigated early before the construction of the engine commenced. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fault diagnostics; Function blocks; IEC 61499; Industrial cyber-physical systems; Multi-agent systems; Quality-driven architectures","Architectural design; Cyber Physical System; Economic and social effects; Embedded systems; Engines; Failure analysis; Iterative methods; Quality control; Software architecture; Telemetering equipment; Architectural trade-off analysis; Current function; Development environment; Fault diagnostics; Model driven development; Quality attributes; Reference architecture; Rigorous evaluation; Software agents","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111761179"

A vast amount of primary resources is spent during the construction of buildings, which uses 50% of raw materials taken from earth. The energy needed to heat, cool, illuminate, connect the fabric of the built environment contributes 36% to global energy use and 39% of energy-related CO2 emissions. At the same time, the building industry is one of the most fragmented, decen-tralized and diverse industries with nearly 3 million workers organized in 800.000 predominantly small enterprises. The vast spectrum of trades and sub-domains along with the diversity of its products ranging from residential buildings to tun-nels and bridges leads to a wide spectrum of information exchanged in temporary processes with fragile value chains. At the same time, the building sector as a whole is trailing in many productivity indices and in its state of digitalization. The potential to save energy and to contribute to the reduction of the car-bon footprint from the sector can be approached from a number of different angles: Improved design and planning for the few new and the many existing buildings; re-use and circular economy for the materials involved and synergetic effects through increased vertical and horizontal integration of processes, and subsystems. All this requires the integration of knowledge domains. 1.2 Semantic DTs in the Built Environment The individual cyberphysical sub-systems that comprise the built environment from individual buildings to vast and highly connected infrastructure networks including traffic, energy, water and waste networks, are designed, operated and maintained in completely separated, heterogeneous information silos with a very low rate of digitalization. Representing, monitoring, simulating and optimizing even of single nodes in these interconnected, multi-layered networks using dig-ital twins has only just begun. Within a single domain of these networks such as an individual building, a road-network or bridge, the current and past sys-tem states, their long-term monitoring and improvement requires comprehensive semantic models digital twin models. Such models are still in their infancy. Cur-rent and evolving information models are still mostly designed to capture static as-planned individual lifecycle stages, have bespoke and disparate insular solu-tions and little to no vertical and horizontal connectivity with other nodes in the network. Information exchange models for different aspects at various levels of granularity from geospatial superstructures (GIS) to building components (BIM) often have hundreds or even thousands of semantic entities and the sheer size of the structured vocabularies to describe products range in the tens of thousands of concepts which often differ on national or even regional levels. 1.3 Use cases and examples In the presentation an overview of ongoing research, development and standard-ization efforts regarding the creation, integration and interoperability of seman-tic Digital Twins for the built environment is provided. Concrete challenges and solution approaches of past and ongoing research from different use cases and application domains of Semantic Digital Twins for-the assessment and energy refurbishing of residential buildings-monitoring and predictive maintenance of bridges-road network interoperability with Linked Data across European borders are used to illustrate these challenges. These include the semantic lifting of legacy data models, the alignment and integration of vast domain vocabularies, multi-modal integration of heterogeneous status information (sensor, images, measure-ments) and ongoing efforts to create reference frameworks for semantically rich Digital Twins in the built environment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Buildings; Digital twins; Infrastructure; Ontologies; Open standards","Construction industry; Digital twin; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Highway bridges; Housing; Integration; Interoperability; Life cycle; Network layers; Roads and streets; Temporary bridges; Construction of buildings; Heterogeneous information; Information exchanges; Infrastructure networks; Integration of knowledge; Long term monitoring; Reference frameworks; Vertical and horizontal integrations; Architectural design","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108914119"

However, there have been challenges in quantifying improvements from the conventional method, which leads to the low uptake. The concept of a digital twin (DT) is useful for OSM, which enables production to be represented virtually and visually including all activities associated with it, resources, and workflow involved. Thus, essential information in the product development process such as cost, time, waste, and environmental impacts can be assessed. However, the data required to have accurate results and better-informed decision-making come from heterogeneous data formats (i.e. spreadsheets and BIM models) and across different domains. The inclusion of semantic web technologies such as Linked Data (LD) and Web Ontology Language (OWL) models has proven to better address these challenges especially in terms of interoperability and unambiguous knowledge systematisation. Through an extensive systematic literature review followed up by a case study, an ontology knowledge structure representing the production workflow for OSM is developed. A real-life use case of a semi-automated production line of wall panel production is used to test and demonstrate the benefits of the semantic digital twin in obtaining cost and time data of the manufacturing for assessment. Results demonstrated the potential capability and power of capturing knowledge for an ontology to assess production workflow in terms of cost, time, carbon footprint thereby enabling more informed decision making for continuous improvements. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twins; Offsite manufacturing; Ontologies; Process modelling; Production workflow","Architectural design; Automation; Carbon footprint; Computer software maintenance; Decision making; Digital twin; Environmental impact; Interoperability; Ontology; Semantic Web; Automated productions; Continuous improvements; Off-site construction; Off-site manufacturing; Product development process; Semantic Web technology; Systematic literature review; Web ontology language; Manufacture","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108912847"

A major aspect, and often an obstacle in the implementation of the co-design approach, is the establishment of a centralized data management system. In the past, the data management concept has been approached from different perspectives. Current approaches usually are oriented along the process chain and thus reflect a unidirectional flow of information. Neither the information feedback nor the reaction to adjustments in upstream model steps is supported, which makes continuous collaboration more difficult and at best reduces the co-design approach for continuous data usage. This paper addresses these weaknesses while outlining an integrative data processing concept enabling co-design between the domains of construction and industrial prefabrication. Geometrical information generated during architectural design and construction planning is reused for the production of components, manufacturing-related design adjustments are transferred back into the domain of construction. Changes throughout the entire process are centrally recorded. To ensure independence from the software tools used and to consider their great diversity, data exchange is largely based on standards, namely industry foundation classes and the standard for the exchange of product model data. In order to counteract the sequential processing according to a waterfall model and to support the co-design approach, the industrial prefabrication toolchain, consisting of computer-aided manufacturing software and downstream postprocessors, is largely automated, so that reprocessing of a workpiece for minor geometric adjustments no longer requires any interaction of the production planner. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AutomationML; CAD; CAM; Co-Design; Data Processing; IFC; STEP","Application programming interfaces (API); Cams; Computer aided manufacturing; Cyber Physical System; Database systems; Electronic data interchange; Embedded systems; Information management; Rivers; AutomationML; Co-design approach; Co-designs; Collaborative design process; Cyber physicals; Elsevier; IFC; Off sites; On-site construction; STEP; Computer aided design","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107842057"

These Mechatronic Integrated Devices (MID) are necessary to meet the increased demands for miniaturization and functional integration. At the same time, the development complexity of these products as well as the dependencies of the production technologies increase. Product and production process must be developed integratively from the outset. The development of MIDs is supported by cross-domain development methods (e.g. VDI2206). However, the generation of solutions is often accompanied by individual solutions such as construction tools for 3D geometry design, routing on spatial surfaces and 2D logic planning for the topology of the mechanics. On the basis of initial domain-specific solutions, a complex, highly iterative optimization process takes place, in which the MID components are adapted to geometric and production-specific conditions. Generative Design offers a promising approach for the automation of design tasks. However, this approach is used outside of architecture only in mechanical designs and does not allow the automation of design aspects of complex multi-domain components like MID. This paper presents an initial approach towards the use of Generative Design in the development of Mechatronic Integrated Devices. The focus is to develop a hybrid design systematic that allows the (partially) automated evolvement of MID components based on a product specification and solution elements to be integrated. The Generative Design process is initiated by the specification of product requirements and constraints (e.g. existing mechanical solution elements). A knowledge base formalized via ontology is used to create a principle solution. Based on an initially generated population the biological-inspired evolution is triggered. Design variants are first synthesized together with 3D routing and then selected based on fitting functions. Satisfactorily evaluated MID variants are continuously mutated and recombined until the final design is created. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Evolutionary Algorithms; Generative Design; Mechatronic Integrated Devices; Product Design","Automation; Biology; Embedded systems; Iterative methods; Knowledge based systems; Product design; Specifications; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Electrical components; Generative design; Integrated device; Mechanical and electrical; Mechanical components; Mechatronic integrated device; Solution element; Spatial integrations; Evolutionary algorithms","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107835717"

As one of the effective solutions for information overload in CPS construction, quality of service (QoS)-aware service recommendation has drawn much attention in academia and industry. However, the lack of most QoS values limits the recommendation performance and it is time-consuming for users to get the QoS values by invoking all the services. Therefore, a powerful prediction model is required to predict the unobserved QoS values. Considering the fact that most existing QoS prediction models are unable to effectively address the data-sparsity problem, a novel two-stage framework called AgQ is proposed for QoS prediction. Specifically, a data augmentation strategy is designed in the first stage to enlarge the training set by drawing additional virtual instances. In the second stage, a prediction model is applied that considers both virtual and factual instances during the training procedure. We conduct extensive experiments on the WSDream dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of the our QoS prediction framework and verify that the data augmentation strategy can indeed alleviate the data-sparsity problem. In terms of mean absolute error, taking the Multilayer Perceptron model as an example, the maximum improvement achieves 5% under 5% sparsity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyber-physical systems; Data augmentation; Neural network; QoS prediction","Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Forecasting; Multilayer neural networks; Predictive analytics; Service industry; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Data sparsity problems; High quality service; Information overloads; Mean absolute error; Recommendation performance; Service recommendations; Training procedures; Quality of service","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107760725"

The construction industry, which accounts for about 30% of the total energy consumption, needs to effectively manage and use renewable energy. The application of building information model (BIM) in the evaluation of retrofitting schemes of existing buildings is one of the main research issues in the field of building digital twins at present.

In recent years, the ability of real-time connectivity to online sensors deployed in an environment has led to the emergence of the concept of the Digital Twin of the built environment. Digital Twins aim to achieve synchronization of the real world with a virtual platform for seamless management and control of the construction process, facility management, environment monitoring, and other life cycle processes in the built environment. However, research in Digital Twins for the built environment is still in its nascent stages and there is a need to understand the advances in the underlying enabling technologies and establish a convergent context for ongoing and future research. This paper conducted a systematic review to identify the development of the emerging technologies facilitating the evolution of BIM to Digital Twins in built environment applications. A total of 100 related papers including 23 review papers were selected and reviewed. In order to systematically classify the reviewed studies, the authors developed a five-level ladder categorization system based on the building life cycle to reflect the current state-of-the-art in Digital Twin applications. In each level of this taxonomy, applications were further categorized based on their research domains (e.g., construction process, building energy performance, indoor environment monitoring). In addition, the current state-of-art in technologies enabling Digital Twins was also summarized from the reviewed literature.

Identification of new rationales, frameworks and methods in support of sustainable and resilient governance and management of the built environment is more urgent than ever. To meet the challenges of the future, and to ensure continued improvement of global welfare, past best practices must be critically assessed and disruptive changes, by means of organization and technology, must be identified and implemented. In this contribution, starting point is taken in an outline of the critical role of the built environment, in the quest for a sustainable and resilient societal developments. Thereafter, a critical inventory is presented with respect to organizational, procedural and technological - and not least regulatory factors which might be associated with past and present best practices in the governance and management of the built environment. With this basis, potentials for radical improvements in current best practices - a paradigm shift in governance and management of the built environment - through utilization of new and emerging technologies, such as cyber-physical systems, Big Data techniques and Artificial Intelligence, are presented and discussed.

However, these technologies are sometimes difficult to use in actual applications due to the lack of incentives for owners of buildings or infrastructures, because the owners cannot calculate their cost-effectiveness and thus consider the installation payment for these technologies as a cost to be reduced. To address this prob-lem, we propose the construction of an “Urban cyber physical system (CPS).” This urban CPS evaluates the earthquake-resistant capability of buildings and/or social infrastructures to help owners easily understand the cost-effectiveness of adopting these technologies. The CPS also calculates the effects of newly-developed technologies, thereby allowing owners to accept new technologies based on their effectiveness.

There are several ways to collect the information of elements in construction sites, such as manual collection, laser scanning, and tag-based methods. But each of these methods has its own limitations. Considering that effective and accurate construction progress monitoring is fundamental to construction management, this paper proposes a novel framework that integrates the latest computer vision methods to realize automatically monitoring construction progress of precast walls, one of the essential components in precast construction. In this framework, object detection, instance segmentation, and multiple-object tracking are combined to collect precast walls' location and temporal information from the surveillance videos recording the construction phase. Status information identified and collected is stored as a JavaScript object notation (JSON) format and then sent into a corresponding building information model (BIM) to timestamp the wall components. Each method in the framework is evaluated, respectively, and the demonstration on a real project proves the feasibility, convenience, and efficiency of this vision-based framework. The research results prove the proposed framework's ability to monitor the construction progress of precast walls automatically.

A controller architecture is proposed that maps finite fragments of the state trajectory history to control inputs. This approach avoids the standard controller construction that employs an onboard automaton which is fragile to memory loss or errors. In contrast, the proposed architecture requires storing only a finite sequence of previous system states in memory and is therefore resilient to memory loss. In particular, the system will operate unaltered after such a memory-loss event once the system recollects this finite sequence of system states. A generalised algorithm is outlined for controller synthesis in this manner. Additionally, we demonstrate the construction and implementation of such a memory-loss resilient controller through an experimental demonstration on a differential-drive robot that experiences memory-loss events. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","controller synthesis; Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS); Linear Temporal Logic (LTL); resilience","Brain; Computer circuits; Memory architecture; Robots; Temporal logic; Controller architectures; Controller synthesis; Differential drive robots; Experimental demonstrations; Linear temporal logic; Proposed architectures; Resilient controller; Transition system; Controllers","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094188664"

To aid in this matter, formal methods (rigorous mathematical and logical techniques) can be used to obtain proofs about the correctness of CPS. In such a context, Runtime Verification has emerged as a promising solution that combines the formal specification of properties to be validated and monitors that perform these validations during runtime. Although helpful, runtime verification solutions introduce an inevitable overhead in the system, which can disrupt its correct functioning if not safely employed. We propose the creation of a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that, given a generic CPS, 1) verifies if its real-time scheduling is guaranteed, even in the presence of coupled monitors, and 2) implements several verification conditions for the correct-by-construction generation of monitoring architectures.

As a result, robots must determine motion trajectories based on the encountered workspace geometry. Learning from Demonstration (LfD) methods have the potential to be used in teaching robots specific tasks through human demonstration, such that robots can then perform learned tasks under different conditions. In this paper, the LfD method is investigated to teach robots how to perform quasi-repetitive construction tasks. Considering ceiling tile installation as the experimental process, the tasks of maneuvering and positioning tiles in a ceiling grid are defined as the target knowledge to be learned. Using a set of human demonstration videos, the designed approach first translates the physical work context, e.g., the pose of the tile, to the target digital twin, i.e., the workspace as-perceived by the robot. The Reinforcement Learning method is then applied to generate the control policy for the robot to perform the subsequent tasks. The proposed method is evaluated in the Robot Operating System (ROS) Gazebo simulator using a KUKA mobile industrial robotic arm emulator and 60 different scenes as test cases. The results show a 78% success rate in installing ceiling tiles based on 3000 virtual and 85 real demonstration videos. The success rate tends to continually rise with an increase in the number of real demonstration videos, confirming the promise and applicability of the LfD method in teaching robot apprentices to perform quasi-repetitive tasks on construction sites. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autoencoder; Ceiling tile installation; Digital twin; Reinforcement learning; Robot apprentice; Robot learning from demonstration; Visual demonstration","Ceilings; Demonstrations; Digital twin; Reinforcement learning; Robot learning; Construction sites; Human demonstrations; Industrial robotics; Learning from demonstration; Motion trajectories; Reinforcement learning method; Robot operating systems (ROS); Teaching robots; Robots","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088870979"

Since it was proposed in 2006, intensive research has been conducted, showing that the construction of a CPS is a hard and complex engineering process due to the nature of integrating a large number of heterogeneous subsystems. Among other approaches to dealing with the complex design issues, model-driven design of CPSs has shown its advantages. In this review paper, we present a survey of research on model-driven development of CPSs. We are concerned mainly with the widely used methods, techniques, and tools, and discuss how these are applied to CPSs. We also present comparative analyses on the surveyed techniques and tools from various perspectives, including their modeling languages, functionalities, and the challenges which they address in CPS design. With our understanding of the surveyed methods, we believe that model-driven approaches are an inevitable choice in building CPSs and further research effort is needed in the development of model-driven theories, techniques, and tools. We also argue that a unified modeling platform is needed. Such a platform would benefit research in the academic community and practical development in industry, and improve the collaboration between these two communities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyber-physical systems; Model-driven approach; Software engineering; System modeling; TP311","Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Modeling languages; Surveys; Comparative analysis; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Economic sustainable development; Enabling technologies; Model driven approach; Model driven development; Model-driven techniques; Techniques and tools; Economic and social effects","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096358797"

Despite their evolution, they are still unmanageable in commercial and industrial buildings, unlike lighting or air conditioning that are fixed infrastructures managed by an intelligent software layer, such as a building management system. The qualities of heterogeneity, numerosity, spatial irregularity, and displaceability have impeded efficient management of plug loads, unless they are appropriately identified in real time. Decades of efforts in both intrusive and nonintrusive load monitoring have not yielded any sufficiently reliable universal mechanism to identify plug loads. In this article, a practical method of uniquely identifying plug loads using a novel socket cyber-physical system is proposed. This socket/receptacle can access the metadata and operational data of plug loads in an automated fashion, thus yielding a live digital profile of plug loads connected to sockets. Based on acquired intelligence, a supervisory control system can contextually identify the plug loads to provide several digitalized services.

RCL transfers the specified type of workpiece box to specified exports according to the personalized demands. It greatly improves the sorting speed and delivery speed of workpiece. However, the construction of RCL is very time-consuming and difficult because of the unintuitive design and complex control. In order to reduce the difficulty of constructing RCL and eliminate the gap between design and control, a research about cyber-physical system (CPS) for design and control driven by digital twin (DT) is conducted. In this research, three key enabling technologies of constructing five-dimensional DT for RCL are illustrated in detail as follows: (1) multi-scale modeling method of RCL; (2) extensible distributed communication framework; (3) fast mapping method of distributed controllers. Finally, this paper provides a case study of using the CPS driven by DT to design and control RCL.

For example, typical industrial robots have been used in grinding process. However, the automatic grinding process by robots is a complex process because it still relies on skillful engineers to adaptively adjust several key parameters. Moreover, it might take a lot of time and effort to yield better grinding quality. Hence, this paper proposed a new framework of cyber-physical robot system with automatic zero-tuning optimization of the process parameters to achieve the desired quality. To overcome the unexpected difference between reality and simulation, proper system calibration can help in precise positioning in real environment, and the cloud database is constructed to record the relative data during the grinding process simultaneously. The proposed zero-tuning methodology combines both neural network (NN) model and genetic algorithm (GA) to generate the best combination of corresponding parameters to meet the desired quality. Experimental results showed that the average error of the output result was 8.93%.

There is an increasing demand to create digital twins as representation of cyber-physical systems and their related models, data traces, aggregated data, and services. Despite a plethora of digital twin applications, there are very few systematic methods to facilitate the modeling of digital twins for a given cyber-physical system. Existing methods focus only on the construction of specific digital twin models and do not consider the integration of these models with the observed cyber-physical system. To mitigate this, we present a fully model-driven method to describe the software of the cyber-physical system, its digital twin information system, and their integration. The integration method relies on MontiArc models of the cyber-physical system's architecture and on UML/P class diagrams from which the digital twin information system is generated. We show the practical application and feasibility of our method on an IoT case study. Explicitly modeling the integration of digital twins and cyber-physical systems eliminates repetitive programming activities and can foster the systematic engineering of digital twins. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cyber-physical systems; digital twins; information systems; model-driven software engineering; software architecture","Cyber Physical System; Digital devices; Embedded systems; Information systems; Information use; Aggregated datum; Class diagrams; Integration method; Medical Devices; Model-driven method; Programming activities; Systematic engineering; Systematic method; Digital twin","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096992990"

Analysis of these traces is crucial for tasks such as system fault finding. Moreover, detecting anomalies in system behavior becomes crucial in safety-critical and time-sensitive systems where delayed detections can lead to catastrophic outcomes. Therefore, we focus on developing a lightweight and explainable approach for safety-critical time-sensitive systems.Given a set of system traces under normal conditions and anomalous conditions, trace-based anomaly detection aims at classifying the trace as anomalous or not. In this work, we introduce GWAD, a greedy workflow graph framework for anomaly detection, a novel greedy graph construction approach for both offline and online anomaly detection in system traces. Our approach utilizes both sequence of occurrence of events and the time interval between their occurrences in learning the normal system behavior. We propose two approaches, first for offline classification of the trace as anomalous or normal using the event occurrence workflow graphs and secondly an online streaming algorithm that monitors the events as they occur in real-time for detecting anomalies increasing system resilience.

BIM is at the same time a tool for planning, evaluation, monitoring and documentation; however, some constraints determine a potential gap between represented reality and actual reality. This gap is determined by the fact that the information within the system is updated manually by expert designers, losing substantial synchronization with the real system under analysis. The risk is also to have a so extensive dataset to make its update management complex for a human user. Currently, to achieve direct interaction between civil structures and digital modeling systems, the scientific community is carrying out researches for the application of digital twin concepts in the field of construction automation. In particular, studies about the integration between IoT sensor networks and BIM start to be explored. The project described in this paper aims to propose such integration with a specific focus on air quality parameters monitoring, leveraging on scalable approaches. The data updating system is based on a distributed IoT sensor network, designed and implemented using free and open-source software; the communication protocols are all based on open broker-based technologies, like MQTT, and the data dashboard aimed to visualize real-time data and historical data series are based on web applications over HTTP.

In such CPS, sensor data is transmitted over the network to the controller, which will make real-time control decisions according to the received sensor data. Due to the existence of spoofing attacks (more specifically to CPS, false data injection attacks), one has to protect the authenticity and integrity of the transmitted data. For example, a digital signature can be used to solve this issue. However, the resource-constrained field devices like sensors cannot afford conventional signature computation. Thus, we have to seek for an efficient signature mechanism that can support the fast and continuous message authentication in CPS, while being easy to compute on the devices. To this end, we introduce two Lightweight Signature schemes (LiS), which are suitable for continuous message authentication commonly seen in cyber-physical systems. In our constructions, we exploit the efficient hash collision generation property of a chameleon hash function to transform a chameleon hash function into signature schemes. In our schemes, the signature of a message m is the randomness r associated with m in a chameleon hash function, such that they can lead to a hash collision with a given message randomness pair $(m', r')$. Thus, the task of a signer is to generate the collision using the private key of the underlying chameleon hash function, and a verifier can verify the signature by checking the hash collision with a known message and randomness pair. We also specifically instantiate the chameleon hash function in such a way that it leads to a fast signing procedure and an optimal storage requirement on the signer side. The optimized signing algorithms are very efficient. Namely, our first scheme requires only three additions and two multiplications, and only one additional hash is needed in the second scheme to resist adaptive chosen message attacks. In addition, the size of the signing key in our schemes is a small constant-sized bit string, which well fits CPS applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","bloom filter; chameleon hash; continuous message authentication; digital signature","Cyber Physical System; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Hash functions; Network security; Random processes; Real time control; Chosen message attacks; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); False data injection attacks; Message authentication; Signature Scheme; Signing algorithm; Spoofing attacks; Storage requirements; Authentication","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096368557"

The construction industry uses them as well but without having a proper understanding of their role. There is a gap in the current framework. In this paper, the relevant theories to specify this gap in terms of what could exist in theory and what is offered by technology are analysed. As a result, a new framework of construction information activities that fills the gap is proposed. The key concepts and relations among them are identified and elaborated within the existing framework.

Therefore, accurate attack graphs play a significant role in systems security. A manual construction of the attack graphs is tedious and error-prone, this paper proposes a model-checking-based automated attack graph generator and visualizer (A2G2V). The proposed A2G2V algorithm uses existing model-checking tools, an architecture description tool, and our own code to generate an attack graph that enumerates the set of all possible sequences in which atomic-level vulnerabilities can be exploited to compromise system security. The architecture description tool captures a formal representation of the networked system, its atomic vulnerabilities, their pre-and post-conditions, and security property of interest. A model-checker is employed to automatically identify an attack sequence in the form of a counterexample. Our own code integrated with the model-checker parses the counterexamples, encodes those for specification relaxation, and iterates until all attack sequences are revealed. Finally, a visualization tool has also been incorporated with A2G2V to generate a graphical representation of the generated attack graph.

This paper presents a novel IFC-based data structure, using which a set of monitoring data that carries diagnostic information on the operational condition of assets is extracted from building DTs. Considering that assets run under changing loads determined by human demands, a Bayesian change point detection methodology that handles the contextual features of operational data is adopted to identify and filter contextual anomalies through cross-referencing with external operation information. Using the centrifugal pumps in the heating, ventilation and air-cooling (HVAC) system as a case study, the results indicate and prove that the novel DT-based anomaly detection process flow realizes a continuous anomaly detection of pumps, which contributes to efficient and automated asset monitoring in O&M. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anomaly detection; Digital twin; Industry Foundation Classes (IFC); Operation and Maintenance management","Data integration; Digital twin; Information management; Monitoring; Office buildings; Anomaly detection systems; Change point detection; Efficient strategy; Facility management; Industry Foundation Classes - IFC; Integration method; Operation and maintenance; Operational conditions; Anomaly detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085247924"

In this paper, we detail the principles of an Open Source SystemC Multi-Disciplinary Virtual Prototyping (SystemC MDVP) framework, which directly tackles with all these issues. We introduce the key concepts and methodology (relationships between Models of Computation and overall synchronization techniques) and insist on the importance of a 'correct by construction' global model elaboration that allows to generate the hierarchy of solvers that make up the final simulator. We then show that a new Model of Computation, Electrical Network, has been added to SystemC MDVP to handle components with non-linear beahviors. The paper concludes with a quick presentation of the echOpen project which aims at designing a low-cost portable echography device modeled and simulated with the nresented nrincinles. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyber-Physical System; Heterogeneous System; Model of Computation; SoC Design; SystemC; Virtual Prototyping","Computation theory; Embedded systems; Open source software; Programmable logic controllers; Software prototyping; Specifications; System-on-chip; Ultrasonic imaging; Virtual prototyping; Virtual reality; Component based approach; Correct-by-construction; Flexible simulation; Heterogeneous systems; Model of computation; Models of computation; Open source frameworks; Synchronization technique; Open systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096149580"

However, the recent increase in connectivity has led to an extended attack vector. Therefore, it is important that CPS are secured against current and - due to their long life span - also against future threats, such as quantum computers. The security of present communication can be broken once a sufficiently powerful quantum computer is available. To protect against this attack vector, applications and protocols should start utilizing quantum-resistant primitives. One approach that maintains common security guarantees and protects against quantum computer attacks is to use hybrid constructions: a combination of classically secure and quantum-resistant schemes. In this work, we propose a hybrid key exchange mechanism for the industrial communication protocol Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA). We describe four distinct instantiations based on selected quantum-resistant key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), namely NewHope, NTRU, CRYSTALS-Kyber, and Saber. We implement our resulting quantum-resistant modifications of OPC UA on two different ARM based platforms and present detailed performance footprints. Finally, we show the feasibility of employing hybrid quantum-resistant key exchange within OPC UA preserving industrial communication against future threats. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hybrid key exchange; Industrial IoT; OPC UA; Post-quantum cryptography","Embedded systems; Factory automation; Industrial internet of things (IIoT); Network architecture; Public key cryptography; Qubits; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Industrial communication protocols; Industrial communications; Industrial environments; Key encapsulation mechanisms; Key exchange mechanism; Post-quantum securities; Unified architecture; Quantum cryptography","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093361548"

However, with the popularization of the IoT technologies, network attacks on the IoT environment are also increasing. To mitigate these security attacks, one of the candidates’ choice is quantum-resistant authentication, but the widely used authentication schemes are inadequate because they cannot prevent the quantum computer attacks. Lattices serving as an extremely promising foundation for post-quantum cryptography have emerged, and hash proof systems (HPS) over lattices have attracted the attention in the quantum-resistant authentication. Most existing HPS schemes over lattices can be used for authentications, but most of HPSs constructions depend on the strong security scheme that can prevent the indistinguishable chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA) and focus on single-bit encryption, which seems unpractical in the IoT environments. An open problem is how to Integrate the vector (or multi-bit) versions of HPS over lattices into IoT environment for authentication with high efficiency. In this paper, to instantiate HPS over lattices and make it more practical for IoT, we follow the methodology from foremost schemes and introduce the smooth projective hash function (SPHF) which is a special of HPS. Then we relax the CCA-secure requirement and give two elegant instantiations of SPHF with rigorous INDCPA security for the open problem by optimizing two classic encryptions over lattices. The key point of the optimization is that we use a diverse public key which cascades multiple learning with errors (LWE) instances instead of a matrix of LWE insurance while we can bypass the coarse straightforward composition. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hash proof system; Internet of Thing; Lattice-based cryptography; Vector encryption","Authentication; Computer crime; Embedded systems; Hash functions; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Authentication scheme; Chosen ciphertext attack; Hash Proof Systems; Internet of Things (IOT); Lattice-based cryptography; Learning with Errors; Post quantum cryptography; Smooth projective hash functions; Internet of things","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074566134"

As-is Building Information Model (BIM) is one of the commonly used geometric digital twin modelling approaches. However, the process of as-is BIM construction is time-consuming and needed to improve. To address this challenge, in this paper, a semi-automatic approach is developed to establish a systematic, accurate and convenient digital twinning system based on images and CAD drawings. With this ultimate goal, this paper summarises the state-of-the-art geometric digital twinning methods and elaborates on the methodological framework of this semi-automatic geometric digital twinning approach. The framework consists of three modules. The Building Framework Construction and Geometry Information Extraction (Module 1) defines the locations of each structural component through recognising special symbols in a floor plan and then extracting data from CAD drawings using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. Meaningful text information is further filtered based on predefined rules. In order to integrate with completed building information, the Building Information Complementary (Module 2) is developed based on neuro-fuzzy system (NFS) and the image processing procedure to supplement additional building components. Finally, the Information Integration and IFC Creation (Module 3) integrates information from Module 1 and 2 and creates as-is Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) BIM based on IFC schema.

Namely, the healthcare system can be seen as a cyber–physical system (CPS) for patient-centric healthcare applications and services, called Health-CPS, based on cloud computing, Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) and big data analytics technologies. Health-CPS has played an important role in healthcare for improving treatment quality and patients’ assistance speed. However, despite these advantages, the development of Health-CPS will be restricted by serious security threats, especially the security threats to the healthcare-related data. Because Health-CPS forward Electronic health records (EHRs), biomedical signals of patients and public health to the cloud which may operate in distributed and hostile environments, novel security mechanisms are required to prevent malicious interactions to the storage infrastructure. Therefore, the cloud providers must take strong security measures to protect the integrity and privacy of the healthcare related data. But most of the researchers do not simultaneously pay attention to both integrity and privacy for Health-CPS. Therefore, we proposed a privacy-preserving data integrity verification model by using lightweight streaming authenticated data structures for Health-CPS. We have given the design idea, architecture, formal definition, security definition, communication protocols of our model in detail. The key construction processes of our model which include initialization, data appending, scale expansion, data query and verification, are also given in this paper.

Findings: The paper contributes to the body of knowledge by proposing a novel iCAM for a trending technology based on the specific requirements of iContract adoption. The interviews show that while the desire to digitalise the contractual environment exists, the readiness of the sector for such a disruptive change is unknown. Practical implications: The findings and proposed conceptual iCAM offers a lens for the further development of the iContract concept by assisting practitioners to forecast digital readiness of the contract process in construction. Originality/value: This study offers a unique and theoretical framework, in an embryonic field, for predicting the success of iContract implementation within construction organisations through the digital, industry 4.0 and revolution. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automation; Blockchain; Construction; Digitalisation; Intelligent contract; Readiness; TAM; TRI","Embedded systems; Industry 4.0; Construction contract; Construction organisations; Contributing factor; Design/methodology/approach; Literature reviews; Technology acceptance model; Technology readiness; Theoretical framework; Forecasting","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081739920"

Design/methodology/approach: A mixed interpretivist and post-positivist epistemological lens is adopted to pursue the proof-of-concept’s development. From an operational perspective, a synthesis of literature using interpretivism provides the foundation for deductive research inquiry implemented within a case study approach. Within the case study, participatory action research (PAR) is implemented to test the proof of concept via three “waterfall” research phases, namely, literature diagnosis and BIM package selection, BDO development and validation and evaluation. Findings: The findings illustrate that a BDO (which represents the digital twin of manufacturing products) can augment and drive automation processes and workflows for construction product manufacturers within a contractor’s supply chain. The developed framework illustrates the benefits of a BDO, by reducing the number of manufacturing processes to effectively eliminate early errors in the model, generates financial savings and reduces material wastage. Originality/value: This research provides a seminal case study that implements BDO to automate construction product manufacturing processes and demonstrates the utilisation of BDO at an operational (vis-à-vis theoretical) level. Future research is proposed to implement a longitudinal approach to measure and report upon the success (or otherwise) of the proof of concept when implemented on fabrications and shop floor procedures. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BIM digital objects; Case study; Construction supply chain; Industry 4.0; IoT; Manufacturer","Digital twin; Industrial research; Knowledge management; Manufacture; Supply chains; Building Information Model - BIM; Case study approach; Construction products; Design/methodology/approach; Manufacturing procedure; Manufacturing process; Manufacturing products; Participatory action research; Architectural design","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079455868"

Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels. The paper reviews the multi-faceted applications of BIM during the construction stage and highlights limits and requirements, paving the way to the concept of a Construction Digital Twin.

The mechanism of multi-system coupling interactions of the slurry supporting process is revealed by establishing the dynamic model of the process. Furthermore, the degree of controllability of the manipulated inputs is analyzed and verified theoretically using singular value decomposition. Based on the analysis of the supporting process dynamics, a cyber-physical system (CPS)-based hierarchical autonomous control scheme is proposed. The execution level digital optimal controllers are designed and auto-tuned. The discrete event-driven control logic is also included in the execution level and modeled as a finite state machine. For comparison purpose, the coordination level controller is implemented using a hybrid switched model predictive controller and a deep neural network, respectively. Various artificial neural networks with different hyper-parameters are trained and compared using big data. The performance of the proposed autonomous control methodology is tested and compared with human operators by using randomly extracted construction field data. The test results show that the autonomous control system with switched model predictive controller outperforms that with the deep neural network and human operators.

In this paper, the definition and some frequently used properties of CFT are formalized and verified in HOL4. Based on this, we formally model a basic theorem library of CFT. As a case study, the CFT library is employed to verify the frequency response of an RLC circuit, which is a critical application for dependable CPS. The formalization of the CFT and its properties and the construction of the formal CFT theorem library can effectively extend the function of the HOL4 system.

Firstly, a risk assessment model suitable for CPS is constructed based on the actual control scheduling of information system. At the same time, considering the constraint conditions of both sides, including the quantity of available resources, rational allocation of resources, cost-effectiveness and the number of attacked nodes, a more perfect information network vulnerability threat assessment model is established. Then, on this basis, the dynamic attack and defence game function and game solution steps are designed to realize the quantitative assessment of information network vulnerability threat of CPS risk assessment.

It has the powerful function of sensing and controlling the physical environment, which is a big wave following the Internet technology. Because the forms of communication, interaction, and collaboration between heterogeneous units within the CPS are intricate and complex, a comprehensive model needs to be established to describe and analyze the CPS. This paper analyzes the CPS architecture and proposes a new and more complete CPS architecture, decomposes according to this architecture, and classifies the physical entities in the CPS. At the same time, event-based modeling thinking is used to define, classify and formalize event messages. Considering the higher real-time requirements of CPS, an event weighting algorithm was designed according to the different priorities of real-time events. In order to reduce the congestion caused by the limited network bandwidth in the CPS system, improve the ability to identify abnormal data with great uncertainty, and fully guarantee the response rate of the CPS system to emergencies, this paper analyzes the complexity of the CPS system from the perspective of information theory. The average dynamic complexity of the CPS system is set as a threshold to determine the level of information entropy of the sensor data in a certain period of time. The CPS system selects high information entropy data to send first.

A phenomenon twin means a computable virtual abstraction of a real phenomenon. In order to systematize the construction process of a phenomenon twin, this study proposes a system defined as the phenomenon twin construction system. It consists of three components, namely the input, processing, and output components. Among these components, the processing component is the most critical one that digitally models, simulates, and validates a given phenomenon extracting information from the input component. What kind of modeling, simulation, and validation approaches should be used while constructing the processing component for a given phenomenon is a research question. This study answers this question using the case of surface roughness-a complex phenomenon associated with all material removal processes. Accordingly, this study shows that for modeling the surface roughness of a machined surface, the approach called semantic modeling is more effective than the conventional approach called the Markov chain. It is also found that to validate whether or not a simulated surface roughness resembles the expected roughness, the outcomes of the possibility distribution-based computing and DNA-based computing are more effective than the outcomes of a conventional computing wherein the arithmetic mean height of surface roughness is calculated. Thus, apart from the conventional computing approaches, the leading edge computational intelligence-based approaches can digitize manufacturing processes more effectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Complex phenomenon; Cyber-physical systems; Digital twin; DNA-based computing; Industry 4.0; Markov chain; Monte Carlo simulation; Semantic modeling; Surface roughness","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083492519"

Their structures are becoming more complex and currently require multi-core processors with scalable shared memory, signal-processing pipelines, and sophisticated software modules to meet increasing computational power, flexibility demands. Additionally, interaction with real-world entities and modern communication capabilities further enhance the mentioned features and give rise to the embedded and cyber-physical systems (ECPS). As a consequence, the reliability of ECPS becomes a key issue during system development. Generally, state-of-the-art verification methodologies for ECPS generate test vectors and use assertion-based verification and high-level processor models, during simulation; however, new challenges arose, such as need for meeting time and energy constraints, handling concurrent software, evaluating implementation-structure choices, ensuring correct system behavior together with physical plants, and supporting new software architectures and legacy designs. This survey deals with the mentioned issues, reviews related literature, and discusses recent advances in symbolic model checking techniques and their applications to control synthesis. Additionally, challenges, problems, and recent advances to ensure correctness and timeliness, regarding ECPS, are discussed. Reliability issues, when developing ECPS, are then considered, as a prominent verification and synthesis application for achieving correct-by-construction systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Concurrency control; Cyber Physical System; Memory architecture; Model checking; Pipeline processing systems; Signal processing; Software testing; Surveys; Assertion-based verification; Communication capabilities; Correct-by-construction; Implementation structure; Symbolic model checking; Symbolic verification; Time and energy constraints; Verification methodology; Embedded systems","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082531439"

In this paper, we address the design of distributed systems composed of peers (state-transitions systems) communicating through message exchanges. We consider choreographies as the formal model, allowing a developer to describe and specify peers coordination as a set of conversations; ie, all sequences of messages exchanged between the communicating peers. Proceeding this way requires building neither the individual peers nor their composition as they may be obtained by the choreography projection. The correctness of the preservation of such messages exchanges by each peer obtained after projection is a key issue, known as the realizability problem. Checking choreography realizability is mandatory to build third-party applications with no coordination error, eg, absence of deadlocks, missing messages, and erroneous messaging order. In our previous work, we have proposed a set of composition operators, allowing designers to build realizable choreographies that are represented by conversation protocols (CPs). In this work, realizability is guaranteed by construction. We rely on the correct-by-construction Event-B method to prove that each CP constructed using our operators is realizable. In this paper, we show how our approach applies and scales to a set of use cases borrowed from the literature and used by the research community. We also show that our approach allows to detect failures and failure recovery in case realizability does not hold. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","choreography realizability; conversation protocols; correct by construction; distributed systems; Event-B; proof and refinement-based methods","Choreography realizability; Conversation protocol; Correct-by-construction; Distributed systems; Event-B; Formal design; Message exchange; Proof and refinement-based method; Realizability; State transition systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076857503"

However, because of traditional construction modes, most previous research has focused on forecasting ex-post analysis of carbon emissions, and few efforts have concentrated on real-time analysis, the lack of which leads to deficiencies in carbon emission control. The industrial transformation of construction has created opportunities for improvement, and similarly the developments in information technology, notably cyber-physical systems (CPS), have shown the potential to contribute to solving this problem. In several other industries, the application of CPS has made significant progress. To strengthen the monitoring and analysis of carbon emissions in prefabricated construction and thus prevent an excessive impact on the environment, this study proposes a real-time carbon emission monitoring (CEM) system for the whole industrial chain of prefabricated construction. To achieve this aim, previous studies on carbon monitoring in the construction industry are reviewed to investigate the applicability of CPS to CEM systems. The functionality of the system is designed according to the requirements of different end users, and five types of hardware are developed for automated data acquisition in real time. In addition, for better utilization of the monitoring system, three different data presentation platforms are developed for customers (desktop platform, browser, and smartphone app). The system can successfully perform real-time monitoring of carbon emissions，which is useful in preventing additional emissions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon emission; Cyber-physical systems; Monitoring system; Prefabricated construction","Carbon; Computational electromagnetics; Construction industry; Cyber Physical System; Data acquisition; Embedded systems; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Prefabricated construction; Automated data acquisition; Carbon emissions; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Impact on the environment; Industrial transformations; Monitoring and analysis; Monitoring system; Traditional constructions; Monitoring","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075968356"

Several of these technologies are mature and available off the shelf; however, in the industrial setting they are rather novel. Two of these are virtual reality (VR), which has grown immensely in the gaming sector, and 3-D imaging, which is commonly used in archeology and construction. This study presents lessons learned from combining these two technologies in an industrial context with the digital twin concept. Three industrial case studies have been performed, and several observations have been identified in all three aspects of sustainability. For example, improved solution fidelity at an early stage can be achieved by externalizing tacit knowledge, and multiple issues during planning and installation phases have been avoided by utilizing the hybrid digital twin models. This type of digital twin enables highly detailed production system access, enabling engineering abilities from anywhere, anytime. Furthermore, the model becomes a powerful communication tool, which has reduced the resistance to workplace changes, as stakeholders lacking computer-aided design (CAD) knowledge can be involved in the change process. The highly detailed models have also allowed more focus to be put on safety and regulations, as these aspects naturally are more suited to experience in immersive VR. In conclusion, the hybrid digital twin concept developed in this study is a promising tool for decision makers and stakeholders alike, bound to benefit those who use it in all three aspects of sustainability. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3D imaging; Digital twin; Manufacturing; Virtual reality","Computer aided design; Decision making; Sustainable development; Virtual reality; Communication tools; Enabling technologies; Engineering abilities; Industrial case study; Industrial context; Industrial revolutions; Industrial settings; Installation phasis; Digital twin","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083218415"

This technology could therefore provide improved and robust decision making for asset management. Although the applications of digital twins vary, this paper focuses on digital twins for structural dynamic systems. A key consideration in developing a digital twin is in the construction of a workflow that defines decisions and interactions within the modelling framework. This process will generally be bespoke to specific applications, however key principles will apply. Furthermore, a workflow will provide a methodology for identifying poor predictive performance and systematically improving predictions via optimal decision making. In this paper a three storey building structure is introduced as a case study in order to motivate the challenges and technologies required of a digital twin. The context of this case study is to develop a digital twin of the building structure that consistently predicts the acceleration response of the three floors given an unknown structural state, caused by a contact nonlinearity between two floors. This reflects realistic challenges for a digital twin in that the physical twin will degrade with age, and its response may change under various loading scenarios, unforeseen in the initial model development phase. Key elements within a potential workflow for this application are discussed. These include indicating when model updating schemes become problematic and how augmenting physics-based models with a data-based component can provide information about poor predictive performance. These techniques are linked to hybrid testing, as a potential method for improving model development based on the physical structure in a controlled offline manner. Finally, the impact of these procedures are discussed for model based control methods in terms of vibration attenuation performance, but also robustness against model uncertainties and external disturbances. The workflow and key technologies investigated in this specific case study are expected to outline the general processes that apply to digital twins more broadly, and provide a clearer understanding of how a digital twin should be implemented. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin; Hybrid testing; Robust control; Validation","Decision making; Floors; Structural dynamics; Uncertainty analysis; Building structure; Case-studies; Computational modelling; Dynamic applications; Hybrid testing; Model development; Physical structures; Predictive performance; Validation; Work-flows; Robust control","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105781832"

In the presented paper the digital twin method is used for making assessments of safety, durability and reliability of bridge structures. Although some numerical modelling is often done when an existing bridge is evaluated, it usually does not involve the simulation of real behaviour under service and environmental loads including chloride ingress, reinforcement corrosion and assessment of ultimate load carrying capacity. The digital twin concept in addition includes an important aspect of the digital twin calibration and validation using the real monitoring data. The paper presents a chemo-mechanical model covering initiation and propagation of chlorides or carbonation. This model is combined with the nonlinear modelling of cracking, bond failure and reinforcement yielding (Cervenka and Papanikolaou (2008). The paper extents the previously developed model by the authors Hájková et al. (2019), Jendele, Šmilauer and Cervenka (2014). The models were implemented in ATENA software and are validated on experimental data. The developed models can be efficiently used in large scale analysis of real engineering problems as demonstrated on applications to an existing bridge structures in Germany.

Supervisor synthesis enables control designers to automatically synthesize a correct-by-construction supervisor from a model of the plant in combination with a model of the control requirements. Subsequently, the controller code can be generated from the supervisor model such that it can be implemented on a programmable logic controller (PLC). In industry, supervisors have to adhere to strict safety standards. To achieve these standards, safety PLCs (SPLCs) are used. For SPLC implementation, the supervisor has to be split into a regular part and a safety part. This paper presents a method to automatically splits a supervisor model for this purpose. To validate the method, a case study on a rotating bridge has been performed. The result is compared to a splitting result made by experts.

Nowadays, CTP are gaining new meaning in manufacturing environments. This is due to the increased number of innovative solutions having a crucial impact on the effectiveness of production. CTP can be defined as manufacturing approaches which are a blend of the traditional and verified manufacturing processes (TPs), such as traditional cutting, grinding or electro discharge machining, with modern technologies (emerging technologies, also known as complex processes (CPs)), which are under constant development, such as hybrid machining, 3D printing, micro and nanomachining, etc. The application of CPs in the process chain requires a calculation of risk and is usually acceptable in developed firms. Various research centers are looking for new applications of CPs and intensively studying their performance. New machine constructions, tools, manufacturing strategies and digital tools (DTs) are inter alia studied. As a result, some of the abovementioned developments reveal new perspectives for production performance. The paper discusses the role and place of these modern manufacturing techniques in CTP structures. It also points to and discusses a risk and reliability analysis. Moreover, teaching methodologies in the area of CTP are indicated, in order to formulate the proper approach of engineers within the CPs' implementation phase.

Bromilow's ""time-cost""model is used as process-based model and general regression neural network (GRNN) as data-driven model. GRNN gave the most accurate prediction among three prediction models using neural networks which were applied, with the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of about 0.73% and the coefficient of determination R2 of 99.55%. The correlation coefficient between the predicted and the actual values is 0.998. The model is designed as an integral part of the cost predicting system (CPS), whose role is to estimate project costs in the early stages. The obtained results are used as Cost Model (CM) input being both part of the Decision Support System (DSS) and part of the wider Building Management Information System (BMIS).

As a central component performing lifting operations and maneuvering heavy loads over long spans, mobile cranes are associated with a large number of accidents on construction sites. Typical mobile crane-related accidents include electrocution, crane tip over, and struck by crane parts or load. One of the main reasons behind these accidents is due to the operator's lack of visibility of the crane itself and the surrounding environment. In this context, visual monitoring and alarming is an effective way to identify and mitigate potential mobile crane-related hazards on construction sites. With the goal of providing real-time safety assistance for mobile crane operations, this paper presents a cyber physical systems (CPS)-based approach to monitoring mobile crane operations in real-time and providing enriched information to the crane operator. The developed CPS-based system was validated on a full-scale construction site to demonstrate its practical functionality.

Quality control in such a multi-roller compaction scenario is a demanding task because it requires collaborative control of the roller fleet to enable the right type of roller to compact the right position at the right time with the right compaction parameters. Traditional intelligent compaction is mainly devised for single roller, and hence falls short of multi-roller control that requires real-time information sharing between rollers. To enable the collaborative control of a roller fleet, a cyber-physical system has been developed for multi-roller compaction monitoring. This paper systematically illustrates the system architecture by dividing the system into five modules, i.e., data collection module, wireless communication module, cloud-based data processing module, feedback control module, and monitoring client. The corresponding managerial mechanism based on the system is explained, which can enable effective information sharing between multiple rollers and different project stakeholders. Two case studies have been carried out respectively in a concrete slab rockfill dam project and an asphalt expressway project in China. In each case, the specific implementation workflow is introduced, and the results are analyzed.

However, due to the frequent construction safety accidents caused by natural factors and human factors, construction safety issues have also attracted the attention of the government and all walks of life. The widespread use of the Internet has made CPS an advanced technology that adapts to new social development methods and strengthens national construction. In this paper, in order to reduce the losses caused by construction accidents, firstly, the types of safety accidents are analyzed. Secondly, on the basis of CPS technology, a safety system for building workers is constructed, which is mainly composed of four parts, which are personnel management system, risk crosswarning system, monitoring, early warning system, and remote monitoring system, combined with related supporting systems. Finally, the fuzzy evaluation method is used to evaluate the safety system. It is concluded that in the process of building safety construction, prejob training should be conducted to help workers establish safety awareness, and workers' contact with not safety areas should be minimized to reduce accidents in advance; the safety supervision system constructed in this paper will help improve the management level of building safety management and reduce the incidence and losses of accidents. The evaluation results prove the superiority and effectiveness of the system. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Accidents; Construction industry; Economic and social effects; Human resource management; Monitoring; Security systems; Advanced technology; Construction accidents; Construction safety; Early Warning System; Fuzzy evaluation method; Personnel management systems; Remote monitoring system; Safety supervision system; Occupational risks","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092148717"

The intention is to make digital technologies applicable over the entire life cycle of the product and thus improve planning, design, construction, assembly, operation, and maintenance. Intelligent digitalization technologies like the digital thread or digital twin will drastically change engineering and construction processes. Consequently, the preliminary aircraft engine design must also be embedded into the context of digitalization. As part of the projects PEGASUS and PERFECT, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) has started the development of the virtual engine platform GTlab (Gas Turbine Laboratory). Its modular architecture ensures a high degree of usability, expandability, and flexibility for the design and assessment of innovative next generation engine and gas turbine concepts. The purpose of this paper is to present the most important aspects of the GTlab framework and how they contribute to meet the requirements of preliminary aircraft engine design in the context of digitalization. A central topic is the digital representation of the engine system, which is realized by a central data model approach. This includes the geometric description of all engine components, as well as additional data such as thermodynamics, aerodynamics, structural characteristics and mass breakdown. In addition, the central data model enables an efficient management of the intricate data flow and the extensive amount of data transferred between the different disciplines and fidelity levels during the aircraft engine design. Further functionalities of the GTlab framework include the automated generation of 3-D geometries by means of a CAD kernel interface, the acquisition of material data via a material database and a standardized gas model interface. Besides the core functionalities, GTlab includes three major modules for the preliminary aircraft engine design from 0-D-performance up to 3-D. The detailed collaborative predesign proces by means of the framework is presented in part B [1], exemplary for a ultra high bypass turbofan suited to a middle of the market aircraft configuration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Aircraft; Aviation; Computer aided design; Data flow analysis; Digital twin; Gas turbines; Life cycle; Machine design; Phase interfaces; Product design; Thermodynamics; Aircraft configurations; Aircraft engine design; Digital representations; Efficient managements; Geometric description; German aerospace centers; Modular architectures; Structural characteristics; Aircraft engines","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091920476"

Coupled with the geometry and joints used within landing gear structural assemblies, finite element models tend to be used to compute the loads acting on landing gear components during ground maneuvers. Concerning novel design approaches for complex structural assemblies, such as probabilistic assessment, optimization or ‘digital-twins’, the computational expense of using finite element models is prohibitive. Surrogate modeling methods have been proposed as a route to reducing the computational expense of assessing complex structural assemblies for static and fatigue design. This paper investigates the application of Response Surfaces, Radial Basis Functions, Gaussian Process Regression and Artificial Neural Networks as approaches to surrogate modeling for landing gear load models. Following the construction of the surrogate models within case studies representing a side stay and complex drag brace component, it was identified that Response Surface and Gaussian Process Regression surrogate models could be used to reduce the computational expense of a landing gear loads assessment from 20 seconds to less than a millisecond. As a result, surrogate modeling methods provide the required reduction in computational expense to support probabilistic design and optimization of complex structural assemblies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Aviation; Complex networks; Computational geometry; Digital twin; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Landing; Landing gear (aircraft); Neural networks; Structural optimization; Surface properties; Computational expense; Gaussian process regression; Ground maneuvers; Probabilistic assessments; Probabilistic design; Radial basis functions; Response surface; Structural assemblies; Finite element method","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091919926"

The challenge of realizing these advanced manufacturing environments with integrated Exoskeletons is represented by missing design and planning methods required to equip future workplaces with this enabling technology. The integration of Exoskeletons in logistics and production activities creates a new hybrid type of workstation that has to be designed according to a scientific approach. The article presents the first steps in developing an innovative approach to planning and optimizing intelligent working environments with integrated adaptive Exoskeletons. The topic harmonizes three main areas of research: a) production technologies and holistic planning of production processes; b) ergonomics, safety and security of workers in production environments and c) configuration based on the components of the new type of wearable robotics, the Exoskeletons. The validation of this approach is provided through the creation of digital human/Exoskeleton models combining digital Exoskeleton with various digital human models. The Digital Twin of the human/Exoskeleton system is the heart of a holistic design and optimization process that aims to assess the appropriateness of the selected Exoskeleton by simulating the tasks performed and adapting the simulation parameters.

Researches show that 30% of that energy is wasted. One of the main reasons for such high energy waste in the commercial (and even private) sectors is a generic assumption about the occupants' preferences. To fill this gap, the objective of this project is to optimize building energy retrofits by creating smart environments that autonomously respond to the occupants' comfort level using affective computing and adaptive systems. This adaptive approach will help optimizing energy consumption without sacrificing occupants' comfort through passive cooling and heating strategy, responding to occupants' preferences detected from their biological and neurological data.

It is necessary to build smart supply chains according to this concept. A network of component enterprises in a supply chain would be modeled as a virtual supply chain in the cyber world. From the viewpoint of Industry 4.0, virtualizing a supply chain is the foundation for constructing a CPS for a supply chain. The virtualization of a supply chain makes it easier for companies to study their integrating and expanding opportunities. By using this CPS, comprehensive and autonomous optimization of the supply chain can be achieved. This virtual supply chain can be used to sim-ulate the planning phase with negotiation, as well as the production phase. In this paper, instead of specific mathematical modeling for each supply chain, a gen-eral configuration method of a virtual supply chain is proposed. The configuration method of a supply chain model is proposed as a virtual supply chain using enterprise e-catalogues. A virtual supply chain is constructed as a multi-agent system, which is connections of software agents that are automatically created from each selected enterprise model in the e-catalogues. Three types of component enterprise models are pro-vided: manufacturer model, part/material supplier model, and retailer model. Modeling templates for these three types of enterprises are prepared, and each template is a nominal model in terms of enterprise’s behavior. Specific component-enterprise models are prepared by filling the appropriate template. Each component enterprise agent is implemented using the enterprise model selected from the catalogues. Manu-facturer, retailer, and supplier e-catalogues, as well as an automatic construction system of a virtual supply chain, are implemented. Methods for developing templates for the manufacturer, retailer and supplier were provided, and the construction system for specific enterprise models (as e-catalogues) is implemented as a trial. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital transformation; Enterprise agents; Multi-agent simulation; Smart manufacturing; Supply chain","Embedded systems; Industry 4.0; Multi agent systems; Sales; Software agents; Supply chains; Automatic construction; Automatic construction systems; Construction systems; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Enterprise modeling; Specific component; Supply chain modeling; Virtual supply chains; Virtual corporation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090967898"

These descriptions include static semantic structural description and dynamic time-series sensors data. Moreover, it is designed to be able to include data from various simulation tools, represented in the same way as sensors data. Thus, relying on these de- scriptions allow easy implementations of both monitoring and interaction tools that can the be interfaced with the Smart Building. Before the re- cent emergence of Smart Buildings, there was very few advantages in applying this concept to the field of construction and building manage- ment. Non-connected buildings don't produce real-time data, and can't be monitored nor operated from computer systems. But now that more and more buildings include IoT devices that allow them to expose data and services, the benefits of creating a Digital Twin to interact with the building, without interrogating the object itself, only by querying its Digital Twin, appears obvious. It then becomes crucial to be able to expose both a static description of the building's components (includ- ing IoT devices structural and functional description) and dynamic data that represent the evolution of the building's states over time. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BIM ontology IoT; Digital Twin; Sensor data management; Smart Building","Buildings; Digital devices; Internet of things; Memory architecture; Real time systems; Dynamic data; Dynamic time; Interaction tools; Real-time data; Reference architecture; Sensors data; Static semantics; Structural descriptions; Digital twin","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086451841"

In particular, connecting mobile entities such as people, things, robots, and cars to cyberspace requires the utilization of wireless technology.

Smart manufacturing is an important feature of Industry 4.0 which uses the networked manufacturing systems for smart production. Current manufacturing systems (5M1E systems) re-quire deeper mining of the data which is generated from manufacturing process. Objective: To map low-dimensional embedding into the input space would meet the requirement of “kernel trick” to solve a problem in feature space. On the other hand, the distance can be calculated more precisely. Methods: In this research, we proposed a positive semi-definite kernel space by using a constant additive method based on a kernel view of ISOMAP. There were 6 steps in the algorithm. Results: The classification precision of KMLSVM was better than SVM in the enterprise data set, in which SVM selected the RBF kernel and optimized its parameters. Conclusion: We adopted the additive constant method in kernel space construction and the positive semi-definite kernel was built. The typical mixed data set of an enterprise was used in simulation. We compared the SVM and KMLSVM in this data set and optimized the SVM kernel function pa-rameters. The simulation results demonstrated the KMLSVM was a better algorithm in mix type data set than SVM. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Additive constant; Manifold learning; Manufacturing systems; Optimization; Positive semi-definite; Support vector machine","Additives; Classification (of information); Embedded systems; Industry 4.0; Service industry; Classification precision; Industrial revolutions; Low dimensional embedding; Manufacturing process; Networked manufacturing systems; Quality prediction; Service innovation; Smart manufacturing; Support vector machines","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086032004"

In this paper, a context-dependent message construction mechanism (CD-MCM) is proposed with the objectives (i) to inform people about the emergence and development of a situation unsafe for them, and (ii) to instruct them what they have to do according to an adaptively computed action plan. To achieve this, the concepts of 'situation' and 'impact indicator' have been introduced in order to facilitate the computation of personalized action plans and to send messages about the level of danger and the requested actions. In both activities, the inferred implications of situations are used as the basis of informing the involved people. The messages are adapted to actual situations. In addition, the concept of 'relevance indicator' was utilized to assess the significance of the standing situations for the concerned people in a quasi-real-time manner. The level of danger was evaluated for each person by totaling the values of the situation-related relevance indicators. This was also used to select the proper message templates from the predefined alternatives in the process of message construction. The personalized messages were generated based on the chosen message template and the various message components describing concerned situations or providing instructions. The CD-MCM was validated in a simulated indoor fire evacuation guiding application. In the practical evaluation of the quality of the generated messages, a sample of test people was involved. The results of the evaluation show that the messages generated by the proposed CD-MCM lead to more effective messaging about the personal context and the expected actions than the messages constructed by using static context information only. The reason is that the proposed template-based message construction mechanism facilitates the appropriateness as well as the articulation of the contents of context-sensitive personalized messages. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Context Awareness; Dynamic Context Information; Guiding Indoor Fire Evacuation; Informing Cyber-Physical Systems; Personalized Message Construction","Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Quality control; Real time systems; Context dependent; Context information; Context- awareness; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Dynamic contexts; Fire evacuation; Personalized messages; Real-time assessment; Dynamics","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078872737"

First, the composition of CPADS is introduced for analyzing the effect of cyber system on the planning goals and constraints, based on which the dependence of the physical system on the cyber system is investigated. Then, the framework of CPADS planning is proposed by comparing it with active distribution system (ADS). Second, the planning is modeled to search for the appropriate DGs capacities, communication mode, and voltage control frequency with the constraints including performance, construction investment, and out-of-limit voltage probability, aiming at minimizing the construction and operation cost of cyber-physical systems and maximizing the DG penetration level. After that, the bi-layer multi-objective programming without considering the random failure of cyber system is adopted to derive the optimal solution set. Monte Carlo Simulation is then performed to solve for the out-of-limit voltage probability due to cyber failures, based on which the final scheme is obtained. Simulations are conducted on the modified IEEE 33-node distribution system.

If the malware was not discovered by a security company on time, it could leave the system running without any safety measures, and eventually lead to an explosion. To detect such attacks, one can track the running status of the devices in the field to know that they are still “alive”. However, in practice, there yet does not exist an efficient and cryptographically secure mechanism/ protocol that can prove the aliveness of a device to control centers over an open network. This paper aims to tackle this practical problem by introducing a new cryptographic notion called Proof of Aliveness (PoA). We propose to use a one-way function (OWF) chain structure to build an efficient proof of aliveness, such that the prover sends every node on the OWF chain in a reverse order periodically, and it can be verified by a verifier with the possession of the tail (last node) of the OWF chain. However, the practicality of this construction is limited by the finite number of nodes on an OWF chain. We enhance our first PoA construction by linking multiple OWF chains together using a pseudo-random generator chain. By integrating one-time signature schemes into the structure, we can achieve auto-replenishment of aliveness-proofs, which implies that this PoA can be used forever without an interruption for reinitialization. To make our proposals more practical, we analyzed the security of the above PoA proposals in the standard model. Besides that, we also specifically defined a security model for the concept of PoA. Our PoA constructions are implemented and evaluated on Raspberry Pis for a demonstration of its performance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Authentication; Auto Replenishment; CPS Security; Cyber-Physical Systems; One-Time Passwords; One-Way Functions; Proof of Aliveness","Accident prevention; Authentication; Cryptography; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Explosions; Malware; Plants (botany); Security systems; CPS Security; Industrial control systems; One time passwords; One-time signature; One-way functions; Proof of Aliveness; Pseudorandom generators; Safety instrumented systems; Network security","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077822413"

These cyber-physical systems provide interoperability, information transparency, and decentralization of decisions. The modular structure, according to Industry 4.0 principle, creates intelligent networks of machines, work pieces, and systems that can predict failures, self-organize themselves, and react to unexpected events. In this paper, we consider the complexity of assembly processes and propose modular structures for assembly processes based on probabilistic formulation. Despite the reliability and precisions that the use of cyber-physical systems such as robotics and automation in assembly processes have introduced, and because of the increasing complexity, there is a need for probabilistic process characterization models for smart assembly planning purposes. First, a new framework for assembly complexity measurement based on processes’ probabilistic and Markovian characters is suggested. Then, two effects of modularization, namely stabilization of components by boundary creation and application modular interfaces, are analyzed. For each case, a probabilistic formulation for assembly formation and analysis is presented. The effect of task sequencing and component modularization on assembly time and cost is considered simultaneously by the Bayesian formulation of the assembly problem. Several heuristics are derived from simulation examples, and the modularization cost is studied through utilization of design structure matrix. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assembly; Modularity; Probabilistic modeling; Sequencing; System complexity","Assembly; Bayesian networks; Complex networks; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Industry 4.0; Interoperability; Modular construction; Robot programming; Structure (composition); Cost and benefit analysis; Design Structure Matrices; Information transparency; Modularity; Probabilistic formulation; Probabilistic modeling; Sequencing; System complexity; Cost benefit analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066112850"

The core principle of the practice is to direct the value-adding operations over the building's lifecycle through the digital design model, resulting in increased reusability, project-specific differentiation, and automation of designs and processes across projects.

While there has been considerable focus on ‘why’ organizations operating in the construction industry need to adopt digital technologies to enable Building Information Modelling, Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 and thus deliver assets more effectively and efficiently, there has been limited attention given to ‘how’ they can realize their expected benefits and simultaneously generate value. In light of the drive for organizations to engage with digital technology we bring to the fore in this paper the need for them to legitimize a process of benefits management prior to making a financial investment to understand ‘how’ digital technologies can coalesce to generate business value and improve their competitiveness. As part of a benefits management strategy, a business dependency network (BDN) can enable investment objectives and their resulting benefits to be linked in a structured manner with an organization's capabilities and changes required to ensure they are realized. Relying on empirical findings derived from nine projects that examined the efficiency gains and advantages of using a digital systems information model from an engineering to asset management perspective, we construct a generic BDN to visualize the structure of multiple cause-effect relationships that are used to organise the capabilities, changes and benefits that need to be considered prior to adoption. The insights and experiences that have emerged from this research provide a frame of reference for construction organizations and asset owners to navigate the benefits realization and change management process, which can be used to ensure their investments in digital technology can effectively respond to business drivers and generate value. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Benefits dependency network; Benefits management; Change; Digital technology, digital twin","Asset management; Competition; Construction industry; Information theory; Investments; Benefits management; Building Information Modelling; Cause-effect relationships; Change; Change management process; Construction organizations; Dependency networks; Digital technologies; Information management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070680411"

However, the construction industry has a poor record for delivering productivity and efficiency advancement. As proven in other industries, digital methods can shorten product development time and cost by reducing prototyping with the use of numerical simulation. Further, a digital twin is an extensive computational model of a product that is planned to improve over its lifecycle by leveraging operational data. This paper presents a coupled simulation for the thermal design of a heating and cooling system that is integrated with a lightweight roof structure. The concrete roof structure is shape optimised to provide a low embodied energy building element, which is thermally activated to supply space conditioning from a renewable geothermal source. This work is focused on the modelling methodology used by the energy domain to support the development of a digital twin for a multifunctional building element. High-resolution analysis is used to resolve building physics issues and to provide the initial system performance. A parametric geometry model is used to apply the hydronic pipework to a complex roof shape. With input from the previous two steps, a reduced resolution method is used to add the characteristics of the system to an industry standard whole building simulation model. This final step allows for the development of initial control strategies for the novel multifunctional element.

This project aims to conduct a systematic critical review including a bibliography analysis on delay literature in construction. The main questions consider what has been learnt from a decade investigating delay causes and effects in the construction literature and what factors have been missed in the literature. This paper also presents a new and challenging question regarding how digital tools and associated technologies may prevent any delay in construction projects, which can change the research direction from delay investigations to identifying prevention factors. The paper identifies the delay dataset, including 493 papers investigating delay in construction, and establishes a specific dataset of papers focusing on delay effects and causes (DEC), including 94 selected papers covering different factors examined in over 29 countries such as Iran, India, Turkey, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Cambodia, Oman, Malaysia, Taiwan, China, Vietnam, the US, the UK, and Egypt. In addition, the paper identifies 30 critical factors with the frequency of occurrences over three times in the DEC dataset and computes their medians of ranking. This paper also discusses digital tools and methods that can be used for delay analysis and preventions, including MS Project, Oracle Primavera P6, and Open Plan by Deltek. The paper discusses the project schedule delay analysis from project management methodology perspectives. It also discusses the current method's limitations and future directions, which are based on the identification of the deficiency areas. In total, four overlooked factors are identified and suggested, including faulty data analysis, unmatched structure of the research questionnaires with new knowledge and standards [e.g., Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK)], overlooked effects of digital technologies [e.g., Digital twin, Navisworks, Building Information Model (BIM), Geographic Information System (GIS), and Integrated Project Delivery (IPD)], and ignored job-site technologies. In addition, the paper presents the DEC model for future studies, including four main key factors. These factors are resources (e.g., project budgets, labour, material, equipment, and digital tool), project context, stakeholders performance (e.g., owner/client, consultant/designer, contractor, vendor/supplier), and external factors (e.g., ground condition, site location, regulation, natural disaster), which may significantly affect delay prevention and should be concurrently considered in the future delay investigations, since they may be required for designing an effective mitigation strategy when these proof points are identified. This would significantly help to utilise digital systems to prevent time overruns in different construction contexts. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BIM; Cost overruns; Delay; GIS; IPD; Microsoft projects; PMBOK construction extension; PMI scheduling standards; Primavera; Risk analysis; Scheduling; Time overruns","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073122692"

The presented case indicates that the new methodology is capable of identifying and proposing reasonable module candidates that address product complexity as well as company-specific strategies.

Most existing work on real-time data retrieval assume that the real-time data under study are always available for retrieval, and the developed scheduling algorithms mainly focus on making real-time decisions while meeting the temporal validity constraints. This assumption, however does not hold in many real-time applications with intermittent data availability. In this paper, we study the Availability-constrained Fresh Data Retrieval (AFDR) problem, which aims to retrieve all required real-time data for a given set of decision tasks on time while taking both the temporal validity and data availability constraints into consideration. We formulate the AFDR problem as an ILP problem and study its complexity under different settings. Given the general case of the AFDR problem is proved to be NP-hard, we focus on the cases that data items have unit-size retrieval time. For the single decision task scenario, we propose a polynomial-time optimal data retrieval algorithm, which consists of a task finish time selection phase and an optimal retrieval schedule construction phase, to solve the AFDR problem. For the multiple decision task scenario, we propose an efficient heuristic algorithm by transforming the temporal validity constraint of a real-time data item to the availability constraint. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms has been validated through extensive experiments. Our results show that the heuristic algorithm outputs around 1:5x feasible cases compared to that of the state-of-the-art scheme. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cyber-physical systems; data availability; Real-time data retrieval; temporal validity","Decision making; Embedded systems; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Interactive computer systems; Job analysis; Polynomial approximation; Real time systems; Search engines; Complexity theory; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Data availability; Data retrieval; Heuristics algorithm; Real - Time system; Real-time data; Real-time data retrieval; Schedule; Task analysis; Temporal validity; Cyber Physical System","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052686967"

Machine learning (ML) introduced in digitized AM provides potential to transform AM data into knowledge continuously and automatically; hence AM products will be designed and manufactured with improved quality. Conventional product development systems, however, fail to fully adopt ML algorithms on the increasingly available AM data for knowledge acquisition. To address the limitation, this paper proposes an algorithmic framework for constructing AM knowledge automatically and continuously from data. The proposed algorithm develops predictive models to correlate process parameters with part structure and properties using ML algorithms on design, process control, in-situ monitoring, and ex-situ measurement AM data. Based on the predictive models, the algorithm constructs prescriptive rules necessary for decision-making in AM product developments. The constructed rule knowledge is stored in a knowledge base by the algorithm for further AM knowledge query and constructions. Then, the algorithm provides feedback to a knowledge-query formulation phase, which forms the algorithm into a closed loop. Through the algorithm, AM knowledge can self-evolve continuously, while reflecting dynamically generated AM data in an automated and autonomous manner. A case study is presented to illustrate the proposed algorithm and a software prototype is developed to demonstrate the algorithm capability. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","3D printers; Additives; Automation; Decision making; Knowledge based systems; Machine learning; Query processing; Software prototyping; Algorithmic framework; Conventional products; Functional parts; In- situ monitoring; Predictive models; Process parameters; Query formulation; Structure and properties; Engineering education","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072989581"

Supervisor synthesis can ease the development process, by synthesizing a correct-by-construction supervisor from a model of the plant and a model of the control requirements. Subsequently, this synthesized supervisor can be used to automatically generate the controller code. However, for a supervisor to be implemented as a (logic) controller, additional properties need to be satisfied which are not guaranteed by supervisor synthesis. These properties are finite response and confluence. In the literature, conditions are provided for a supervisor, modeled as a set of finite-state automata, to have finite response and to be confluent. Algorithms are defined to check these conditions. Recently, extended finite-state automata, i.e, automata augmented with variables, are being used increasingly often in the context of supervisory control. In this paper, sufficient conditions and algorithms are provided that can be used to verify if a supervisor, modeled as a set of extended finite-state automata, has finite response and is confluent.

Then, the metamodel to formally describe cyber-physical systems is proposed and mapped into the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), an open international standard for building information modeling (BIM). Finally, the IFC-based approach is verified using software of the official IFC certification program, and it is validated by BIM-based example modeling of a prototype cyber-physical system, which is physically implemented in the laboratory.

There is the need for construction educators to target, attract, and prepare minority students who persist into construction professional roles and contribute to industry advancements. Identity theories emphasize that students' lived experiences shape their professional identity development processes and career decisions; and, in the long-term, influence students' persistence and career success. Construction students with strong professional identities are likely to persist and have smoother transitions into construction professions (CPs). However, little is known about the lived experiences of construction students, particularly students at historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs); and, how these experiences influence their construction professional identity development (CPID). Consequently, the purpose of this research was to gain insights into HBCU students' lived experiences and how their CPID evolved across four educational stages. Using a self-reporting survey instrument in a mixed methods approach, 45 HBCU construction students described experiences that influenced their CPID and rated their own CPID using a five-point Likert scale. Data analysis involved weighted means and descriptive analysis of frequently occurring words and emerging thematic categories. T-tests were used to assess the statistical significance of differences existing between different categories of students. Results showed that across the four educational stages, seven thematic categories (technology, engineering, science, fine/performing arts, sports, arts, and non-degree) of evolving career interests emerged from the data analysis. Majority of CP career decisions occurred at the middle-school age, making it a critical time to introduce age-appropriate construction learning opportunities. The six thematic categories that emerged from students' reasons for switching career interests were psychological, experiential, academic, physical, social, and economic; and these reasons corresponded with the educational stages. While pre-college reasons for switching career interests were mostly associated with new knowledge and experiences, college reasons were associated with barriers that hindered students' progression. HBCU construction students had positive perceptions of their own CPID with a high sense of belonging, self-efficacy, and self-recognition. CPID was neither gender nor classification dependent. However, it was most influenced by personal, academic, and industrial experiences. Furthermore, students indicated a strong preference for hands on activities, industry connections, and instructor preparation because these enhanced their CPID. Empirical findings provide insights into CPID to inform educational practices and policies for the early targeting, attraction, preparation, and persistence of construction students, particularly at HBCUs. In the long term, effective practices and policies could increase the quantity and quality of CPs towards a more competent and diverse workforce for the development of 21st century built environments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Construction; Data handling; Engineering education; Information analysis; Personnel; Professional aspects; Colleges and universities; Construction learning; Construction professionals; Descriptive analysis; Industrial experience; Knowledge and experience; Professional identity; Statistical significance; Students","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078740497"

Among various design considerations, this paper mainly discusses scalability, mobility, reality, extensibility, consideration of the domain or vendor specificities, and the visualization of physical facilities and their damage as caused by cyber attacks. The main purpose of the study was to develop a platform that can maximize the coverage that encompasses such design considerations. We discuss the construction of the platform through the final design choices. The features of the platform that we attempt to achieve are closely related to the target cyber exercise format. Design choices were made considering the construction of a realistic ICS/SCADA exercise environment that meets the goals and matches the characteristics of the Cyber Conflict Exercise (CCE), an annual national exercise organized by the National Security Research Institute (NSR) of South Korea. CCE is a real-Time attack-defense battlefield drill between 10 red teams who try to penetrate a multi-level organization network and 16 blue teams who try to defend the network. The exercise platform provides scalability and a significant degree of freedom in the design of a very large-scale CCE environment. It also allowed us to fuse techniques such as 3D-printing and augmented reality (AR) to achieve the exercise goals. This CPB platform can also be utilized in various ways for different types of cybersecurity exercise. The successful application of this platform in Locked Shields 2018 (LS18) is strong evidence of this; it showed the great potential of this platform to integrate high-level strategic or operational exercises effectively with low-level technical exercises. This paper also discusses several possible improvements of the platform which could be made for better integration, as well as various exercise environments that can be constructed given the scalability and extensibility of the platform. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cyber conflict; cyber exercise; cyber-physical systems; ICS/SCADA testbed","3D printers; Augmented reality; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Design; Embedded systems; Intelligent control; National security; Network security; Scalability; Critical infrastructure protection; cyber conflict; cyber exercise; Cybersecurity exercise; Degree of freedom; Design considerations; Multi-level organizations; Security research; Cyber Physical System","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069199084"

However, traditional engineering interventions to improve upon these systems are unfavorable as they entail large-scale and cost-prohibitive infrastructure construction, and are a static solution to a dynamic and evolving problem. Recent accessibility of low-cost sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless communication technology has made it possible for the existing stormwater networks to be retrofitted with an assortment of cyber-physical technologies that allow for inexpensive, versatile, minimally-invasive, and fully-automated stormwater control interventions (e.g. hydraulic valve operated by cellularly-connected actuator) [4] [9] [12]. To give an example demonstrating the impact of this automation, one sub-system of a stormwater network that was retrofitted with sensor-actuators demonstrated a performance enhancement of 80% when compared with traditional passive systems [5], with other studies demonstrating similar enhancements [3][1][10][6][7][8]. With the demonstrated success of automating individual components of a stormwater network, there now exists the possibility for these individual components to be strategically coordinated and operated to achieve system-level automated control [2] [11] [10], potentially leading to dramatic changes in how entire urban watersheds are able to dynamically respond to storm events. However, given the emerging nature of the smart stormwater networks field, there currently does not exist a framework to (i) objectively compare the performance of the control algorithms behind these smart stormwater interventions, and (ii) assess the generalizability of the control algorithms across a diverse set of stormwater networks and weather events. We have developed a benchmarking framework which provides a means to systematically and objectively compare performance of control algorithms for a variety of stormwater networks. This framework includes the following: (1) A collection of anonymized stormwater networks (based on actual networks) used as case studies for control algorithms to be directly compared, (2) Corresponding storm inputs to these stormwater networks to evaluate the performance of control algorithms across diverse types of storm events, (3) A set of scoring metrics for analyzing the performance of network control and optimization interventions. This benchmarking framework is an effort to make smart stormwater network control problems accessible to control experts outside of the field of water resources engineering. Creating this framework will facilitate future research to focus on the development and implementation of control algorithms, minimizing the prior need to first master stormwater simulation. The framework will be hosted online such that the testing and comparison of new control algorithms can occur effortlessly. Eventually, “competitions” will be coordinated to encourage solutions to novel smart stormwater problems. This demo will present an overview of the computational benchmarking toolbox, implemented in Python, for smart stormwater networks. Example simulations of the stormwater networks will be carried out, demonstrating how new control algorithms can be developed and applied to the corresponding benchmarking problems. Additionally, it will be demonstrated how to submit the performance results of new algorithms to compare with previously submitted solutions. Prior experience in computational modeling of stormwater systems will not be necessary. Instead, to bridge knowledge gaps, we will lead a discussion on the complex nuances of stormwater systems (e.g. stochastic nature of precipitation events and system response; diversity of stakeholder participation and system-level goals) that influence the appropriateness of specific control strategies applied. Additionally, this demo will present a wireless hardware platform that allows for cost effective measurements and real-time control of stormwater systems. This hardware serves as a foundation for the assortment of cyber-physical technologies (e.g. wireless sensor nodes) that have been developed and deployed by the Real-time Water Systems Laboratory at the University of Michigan. Our goal is to use this demo to build collaboration with the Cyber-Physical Systems community, a community who may be unfamiliar with the field of stormwater and urban watershed systems, but whose expertise in controls and optimization may contribute positively to continuing the advancement of smart stormwater networks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Real-time control; Smart cities; Water infrastructure","Automation; Benchmarking; Cost effectiveness; Cost engineering; Costs; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Hydraulic actuators; Real time control; Sensor nodes; Smart city; Stochastic systems; Water resources; Watersheds; Control and optimization; Infrastructure construction; Performance enhancements; Stakeholder participation; Traditional engineerings; University of Michigan; Water infrastructure; Wireless communication technology; Storms","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066629981"

In this paper, the related research and application of DT technology are systematically studied. Then the concept and characteristics of DT are interpreted from both broad sense and narrow sense. On this basis, an application framework of DT for product lifecycle management is proposed. In physical space, the total-elements information perception technology of production is discussed in detail. In the information processing layer, three main function modules, including data storage, data processing and data mapping, are constructed. In virtual space, this paper describes the implementation process of full parametric virtual modeling and the construction idea for DT application subsystems.

However, hybrid automata lack expressiveness compared to integrated model-based design frameworks such as the MathWorks’ Simulink/Stateflow (SlSf). In this paper, we propose a technique for correct-by-construction compositional design of cyber-physical systems (CPS) by embedding hybrid automata into SlSf models. Hybrid automata are first verified using verification tools such as SpaceEx and then automatically translated to embed the hybrid automata into SlSf models such that the properties verified are transferred and maintained in the translated SlSf model. The resultant SlSf model can then be used for automatic code generation and deployment to hardware, resulting in an implementation. The approach is implemented in a software tool building on the HyST model transformation tool for hybrid systems. We show the effectiveness of our approach on a CPS case study—a closed-loop buck converter—and validate the overall correct-by-construction methodology: from formal verification to implementation in hardware controlling an actual physical plant. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hybrid automata; Model-based design; Simulink/Stateflow","Automata theory; Automatic programming; DC-DC converters; Embedded systems; Hardware; Hybrid systems; Automatic code generations; Correct-by-construction; Cyber-Physical System (CPS); Hybrid automatons; Integrated modeling; Model transformation; Model- based designs; Simulink; Formal verification","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020745888"

To both, time and energy are the most critical operating resources. Considering for instance the Tactile Internet specification, end-to-end latencies in these systems must be below 1ms, which means that both communication and system latencies are in the same order of magnitude and must be predictably low. As control loops are commonly handled over different variants of network infrastructure (e.g. mobile and fibre links) particular attention must be payed to the design of reliable, yet fast and energy-efficient data-transmission channels that are robust towards unexpected transmission failures. As design goals are often conflicting (e.g. high performance vs. low energy), it is necessary to analyze and investigate trade-offs with regards to design decisions during the construction of cyber-physical networks. In this paper, we present Δelta, an approach towards a tool-supported construction process for cyber-physical networks. Δelta extends the previously presented X-Lap tool by new analysis features, but keeps the original measurements facilities unchanged. Δelta jointly analyzes and correlates the runtime behavior (i.e. performance, latency) and energy demand of individual system components. It provides an automated analysis with precise thread-local time interpolation, control-flow extraction, and examination of latency criticality. We further demonstrate the applicability of Δelta with an evaluation of a prototypical implementation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aerospace; Cyber-Physical Systems; Etc.); Internet of Things; Multimedia; Networked Embedded Systems and Sensors; Performance Evaluation; Simulation and modelling tools of real-time networks (Automotive","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062387902"

Collaborative control of multiple rollers in the construction site to enable each roller to compact the right position at the right time with the right compaction parameters to ensure compaction quality is an unaddressed challenge. There are three technical barriers, i.e. how to collect and communicate compaction data of each roller, how to aggregate the collected data to determine compaction parameters, and how to control the roller fleet based on the real-time compaction parameters. To address the technical barriers, a cyber-physical system is designed and implemented. A framework is proposed for multi-roller compaction monitoring, which consists of five modules, i.e. data acquisition module, data transmission module, remote servers, in-situ control module, and monitoring terminal. Algorithms are created to calculate compaction parameters in the scenario of multi-machine operations. A managerial mechanism involving cyber space, human intervention, and compaction machines is set up to achieve collaborative compaction control. Field experiments were conducted to validate the efficacy of the system, of which the results suggest the proposed system can effectively control the compaction process. With inappropriate compaction effort being identified, tracked, and rectified in real time, the compaction quality is ensured.

Therefore, the original idea of the research is to determine the relationship between safety system (SS) during the implementation phase (IPh) of CPs and the minimisation of waste (materials, time and cost). Achieving a lean construction work requires suitable planning, safety considerations and waste resource minimisation throughout the project cycle. This research aims to identify and rank the safety factors during the IPh of a CP, which will have positive effects on minimising waste. Information and data were gathered from the existing literature and the structured interviews and questionnaire survey conducted among 111 randomly selected construction companies. Questionnaire results were evaluated using statistical tools, such as hypothesis testing, analysis of variance and linear regression. This research identified and ranked 24 important safety factors with positive effects on minimising waste in CPs during IPh. The seven most important safety factors that should be considered to minimise material, time and cost wastage are as follows: handling, management, external factors, workers, procurement, site condition and appropriate scaffolding for SS. The best linear model was developed on the basis of the importance index of the identified factors. This model can predict the minimisation of waste (materials, time and cost) in CPs by using SS. Thus, the safety criteria and SS should be used during IPh to minimise waste on the basis of the developed model. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Construction safety; Construction waste; Implementation phase; Safety system","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060269897"

Increasing amount of information on the use, behaviour and performance of infrastructure assets enables better decision making and asset value management. Digitalisation enables more effective utilisation of existing assets, better design, selection, and delivery of new assets. Asset data can contribute to improving the value of an asset in its life-time, a citizens’ quality of life, and economic growth. Asset data is key for smart infrastructure management. Process and technology advancements enable the transformation of physical infrastructure into a smart infrastructure (digitally represented by digital twin) which may store the historical and real-time status of a physical counterpart. This paper targets methods, processes, and technologies which may be used to better capture, organise, analyse and understand the status and behaviour of infrastructure assets. Presented smart asset management maturity model will enable asset owners to introduce new methods of monitoring and decision making that may lead to the innovative smart infrastructure asset management. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108624166"

Due to their excessive complexity, the number of vulnerabilities in both the software and the physical part of the equipment significantly increases, which in turn leads to increased risks from the implementation of possible threats. Implementation of the overwhelming part of cyber threats occurs through intelligent telecommunication networks, attacks on data transmission protocols, intellectual part of data sources in executive mechanisms of systems, as well as local control centers of the system. The construction of adequate requirements for the system of cybernetic protection implies a careful approach to the study of the architecture and technical features of the cyberphysical system to be protected. As in any real engineering system, in systems of protection of cyber-physics systems, modeling of internal processes plays a key role in the analysis of their dynamic behavior. It is shown that the only model of the cyberphysical system is to describe at the formal level in spatial and temporal measure all possible connections between the cybernetic and physical parts of the functioning environment and to substantiate the characteristics that determine the quality of its functioning. This analysis of published works shows that the most dangerous attacks used by security breachers in cybernetic space are divided into attacks such as DoS attacks, Replay attacks and Deception attacks. It is against the attacks of this type that the efforts of specialists in the field of cybernetic defense are concentrated. It is shown that ensuring stability, security and reliability of protection is based on solving the problem of multi-purpose optimization. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyber-Attack; Cyber-physical system; Cyber-security; Cyberspace; Deception attacks; DoS attack; Physical space; Replay attack; Wormhole attack","Cybernetics; Denial-of-service attack; Community management; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Data transmission protocols; Dynamic behaviors; Executive mechanism; Multi-purpose optimizations; Security and reliabilities; Technical features; Embedded systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093365052"

The paper further puts forwards six propositions on the city-level digital twin agenda, which stem from an ongoing research project on smart cities at the Cambridge Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction. It is argued that the development of a digital twin is progressive, where the digital twin as a technical apparatus and the social system that develops, operates and uses the digital twin must co-evolve together. On the one hand, our existing knowledge about cities and infrastructure would define how well we could build and evaluate the digital twin; on the other hand, thanks to artificial intelligence, the digital twin could potentially produce new knowledge that complements ours. In the context of developing smart cities, the paper points out that the digital twin is not a context-free technology that can be simply purchased and installed onto existing governance systems. To develop a purposeful digital twin application, the insights and changes from the governance perspective are essential. The paper also introduces the research plan for developing a digital twin pilot for the Cambridge sub-region, which serves as a case study to test the proposed propositions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Artificial intelligence; Binary alloys; Decision making; Smart city; Cambridge; Context-free; Governance systems; National infrastructure; Research plans; Smart infrastructures; Social systems; Sub-regions; Digital twin","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090989616"

DTs integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics to create dynamic digital models that are able to learn and update the status of the physical counterpart from multiple sources. A DT, if equipped with appropriate algorithms will represent and predict future condition and performance of their physical counterparts. Current developments related to DTs are still at an early stage with respect to buildings and other infrastructure assets. Most of these developments focus on the architectural and engineering/construction point of view. Less attention has been paid to the operation & maintenance (O&M) phase, where the value potential is immense. A systematic and clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a DT is the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of assets. This paper presents a system architecture for developing dynamic DTs in building levels for integrating heterogeneous data sources, support intelligent data query, and provide smarter decision-making processes. This will further bridge the gaps between human relationships with buildings/regions via a more intelligent, visual and sustainable channels. This architecture is brought to life through the development of a dynamic DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the University of Cambridge. Specifically, this demonstrator integrates an as-is multi-layered IFC Building Information Model (BIM), building management system data, space management data, real-time Internet of Things (IoTj-based sensor data, asset registry data, and an asset tagging platform.

Firstly, an explicit expression of real-time DLMP is derived based on radial structure, small bus voltage phase angle changes, and high R/X ratio features of practical smart distribution systems, by leveraging the distribution system state estimation results. This derived explicit expression of real-time DLMP is analyzed based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, which reveals that the real-time DLMP can be modified by manipulating bus voltage information through FDI attacks. Then, the practical construction of FDI attacks against real-time DLMP is investigated based on an optimization problem under the constraints of minimum sparsity for FDI attacks and voltage regulation and power balance for system operation. Further, based on the features of practical power distribution system, this optimization problem is transformed into a convex-concave fractional programming problem, which is solved by using the Dinkelbachâ™s algorithm at low computational complexity. A case study based on modified IEEE 13-bus test feeder is conducted to illustrate the potential impacts of FDI attacks in CPS-based smart distribution systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Mathematical programming; Real time systems; Bus voltage; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; False data injection attacks; Locational marginal pricing; Optimization problems; Radial structure; Real time distribution; Smart distribution systems; Voltage phase angle; Voltage regulators","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081977718"

An independent t-test, Pearson correlation and contextual analysis were used to examine differences in mindfulness characteristics, emotional stress, and organizational performance. The findings revealed that most of the mindfulness characteristic items received significantly higher scores among the MBSR participants as compare to non-participants. The results of all analysis (i.e., independent t-test, Pearson correlation, and contextual analysis) show that mindfulness characteristics have a direct influence on CPs, improving their organizational performance by reducing their emotional stress. Therefore, this study reveals that MBSR workshops have a practical impact, both reducing stress and improving performance. It is thus recommended to introduce this new approach in organizations, particularly in the construction industry. Finally, we also propose new directions for further research, including longitudinal studies to identify the long-term effects of MBSR training in the construction industry. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Construction; Correlation methods; Surveys; Construction professionals; Contextual analysis; Emotional stress; Improving performance; New approaches; Pearson correlation analysis; Performance; Stress performance; Stress reduction; T-tests; Construction industry","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080910184"

While the use of BIM begins to show its effectiveness in building construction, it does not satisfy yet linear infrastructure domain. One of the requirements is to manage the infrastructure project data around a common information system, as defined by the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) definition. Recent studies suggest the combined use of PLM and BIM for linear infrastructure construction projects such as roads and railways. The advent of new information technologies, such as Digital Twin, is promoting industrial digital transformation. Effective lifecycle management must now consider all phases of the project, especially Operations and Maintenance (O&M), where the use of the 3D model is no longer the digital model, but the digital duplicate of the Infrastructure. To facilitate the digital transition when projects are split into several phases, the linear infrastructure must be represented by one and only one Digital Twin during its life cycle. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BIM; Digital twin; Linear infrastructure; PLM","3D modeling; Architectural design; Construction; Construction industry; Digital twin; Information management; Information systems; Project management; Structural design; Building Information Modelling; Digital model; Digital transformation; Infrastructure project; Life-cycle management; Linear infrastructure; Operations and maintenance; Product life cycle management; Life cycle","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076751530"

To address this, owners have historically tried to transfer risks to contractors through combative contracts. However, with few mechanisms in place for finding or capturing early upside opportunities, this approach appears to exacerbate losses to owners. Excessive contingency allocations, reduced scope, low-quality work, missed schedule and cost targets and stressed contractors have become normal. New thinking to resolve the Megaproject Paradox, is looking to risk management culture as well as the ability of existing organisational structures to effectively capitalise on the promise of Digital Engineering. Critical to this is effectively answering the “where, what and how” questions during the Initiation and Planning phases of a project. Significant opportunities for economic and environmental savings are bound in the justification of “where and what” to build in the context of the geological setting, which underpins “how” to build. For example, ensuring foundations are tailored to the geology or minimising rock dredging will save a significant percentage of the overall project budget and, define appropriate construction strategies. However, due to the lack of high-quality digital data for geological modelling, Digital Engineering and Building Information Modelling (BIM) currently does not attempt to answer “where and what”, or does so poorly. Geology is generally left to the contractor to manage as “known unknowns” and owners guess at alignments and design. Low resolution and single parameter legacy geophysical and geotechnical techniques are inadequate and do not provide the digital data, or the level of detail required to realise the potential of Digital Engineering. Ground modelling based on real world data must become a tenant of early project definition. Owners cannot afford to continue to guess at where to put infrastructure or how to build and, stakeholders must not allow it. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asset Management; Digital Twin; DigitalGround; Integrated Digital Ground Modelling","Asset management; Budget control; Construction industry; Contractors; Geology; Risk management; Building Information Modelling; Construction strategies; Digital engineering; Digital Twin; DigitalGround; Geological modelling; Management culture; Organisational structure; Architectural design","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075078729"

With the constant, fast-moving advancements in technology, innovative methods for delivering projects are being used more frequently in the consulting world. Web portals and story maps are a powerful way to engage with stakeholders and share information such as design reports, construction drawings and technical reports as well as 3D visualisations and imagery. Following positive client response from key pilot projects, these innovative project delivery methods are regularly being used to convey project findings or present solutions in the coast and ports environment. Our experience has shown clients appreciate the visual aspect of this type of delivery rather than solely relying on report-based deliverables. Visualisations offered by this delivery process also help to bridge the gaps between technical and non-technical stakeholders as they provide clearer representation of the project outcomes and how it may affect them. This enables clients to better estimate buy in from stakeholders on projects - especially in the feasibility stage. Projects on the coastline typically have a large variety of interested stakeholders and it is found that by implementing a visual design process, it helps them understand high risk and low risks aspects of the project and in turn, the approvals and the delivery stage of the projects are streamlined. The range of possible outputs is diverse and these can be tailored, based on the client and project needs.

It is conspicuous that among Industry 4.0, the digital ship has become a necessity. To achieve this goal in the short term, the marine industry must embrace a digital transformation from design to operation phases, a genuine and not trivial challenge. Starting with design, the industry is gently adopting new procedures. Traditional design processes will not be enough in a short future, being necessary to incorporate technologies such as Artificial Intelligence or analytics to all stages of design. Continuing with construction phases, the naval industry must incorporate tools such as Virtual Reality and Smart classification processes in order to achieve the best results and maintain traceability of the project. Finally, regarding operation, IoT connectivity for real time analysis, combined with analytics will provide the renowned term of Digital Twins. In all these phases, making a digital twin a reality today must face many challenges for different reasons.

The calibration was done by moving a Live Load across the bridge and use the strain gauges to detect weight, speed, and spacing of the passing trucks. The measured configuration of the Live Load has subsequently been applied to a Digital Twin creating the digital responses.

In the current trend of the marine industry, shipyards were able to introduce automation and cyber-physical system to their hull panel lines and pipe fabrication facilities due to the presence of established logistical arrangements, factory-like manufacturing feature with fixed conditions of inputs, outputs, and flexibility of modifying production processes. Some of the supply chain systems that have been adopted by many include the lean production concept, Toyota Production System (TPS), just-in-time production (JIT), one-piece flow and Kanban system which were proven effective by the automotive industry to eliminate waste and improve their manufacturing line. However, in the context of shipbuilding, there are three construction stages in chronological order, respectively; fabrication, assembly and block erection. Such logistical system does not extend beyond fabrication stage due to various circumstances; therefore the disproportion in logistical flow between the fabrication facilities and the assembly areas are often not optimised which is counterproductive and overshadows the improvement efforts contributed by the fabrication facilities. This paper presents a logistical process flow between panel fabrication and assembly stage through Flexsim software simulation. An actual case study of a TPS integrated panel line and the block assembly bay will be modelled and validated with the fabrication of a realistic offshore design vessel. Virtual performance of the flow will be investigated to understand the implication of different operating conditions. The outcome of the paper will provide a framework for actual panel line to analyse the feasibility of implementing TPS, and also identify the critical control point to mitigate the effects caused by the disproportion in the panel logistical flow. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Application programs; Assembly; Automotive industry; Hulls (ship); Just in time production; Marine industry; Offshore oil well production; Productivity; Shipbuilding; Shipyards; Supply chains; 'current; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Hardware and software; Manufacturing features; Panel lines; Production facility; Software applications; Supply chain systems; Toyota Production System; Fabrication","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074447398"

An architecture of IoT-enabled smart cities based on this data acquisition framework is also demonstrated. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Buildings; Cyber Physical System; Data acquisition; Embedded systems; Smart city; Sustainable development; Building systems; Built environment; Common datum; Data protocol; Inter system; Internet of thing (IOT); Larger networks; Smart community; Internet of things","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068756537"

The Catoptric Surface research project uses computation and robotics to precisely control the location of reflected daylight through a building envelope to form an image-based pattern of light on the building interior’s surfaces. In an attempt to amplify or reduce spatial perception, the daylighting reflected onto architectural surfaces within a built environment generates atmospheric effects. The modification of light patterns mapped onto existing or new surfaces enables the perception of space to not rely on form alone. The mapping of a new pattern that is independent of architectural surfaces creates a visual effect of a formless atmosphere and holds the potential to affect the way people interact with the space. People need different amounts and quality of daylight depending on physiological differences due to age or the types of tasks they perform. This research argues for an informed luminous and atmospheric environment that is relative both to the user and more conceptual architectural aspirations of spatial perception controlled by a cyber-physical robotic façade system. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computation; Contextual","Calculations; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Robotics; Atmospheric conditions; Atmospheric effects; Atmospheric environment; Building envelopes; Building interiors; Contextual; Interior environments; Physiological differences; Architectural design","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068389909"

Wuhan Metro's Sanyang road tunnel, which crosses the Yangtze River in China, was selected for this case study. A slurry shield machine with a cutter diameter of 15.76 m was designed to be hoisted for 44 m into the underground tunnel shafts. The major challenges of this hoisting were as follows: 1) complex construction environment for hoisting, 2) limited visibility of crane operator or blind hoisting, and 3) precise control of position and gesture of a giant cutter wheel in real time. To overcome these challenges, the CPS-SMS was proposed to simulate and monitor the hoisting process to avoid the unsafe status of cranes and the hoisted cutter wheel. Internet-of-things technologies, such as wireless sensor-based location and tracking, self-organized Wi-Fi, and bi-directional communication, were used to prevent accidents in the changing and dynamic hoisting process. The implementation of monitoring blind hoist in the Yangtze River, which crosses the metro tunnel construction site, was successful, that is, no collision or injury occurred. The CPS-SMS can be applied by practitioners to various construction projects, such as dams, high-rise buildings, and large-scale infrastructure projects, to decrease the likelihood of safety risks in blind hoisting in complex environments. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blind hoisting; Crane safety; Cyber-physical system; Internet-of-things (IoT); Safety management","Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Internet of things; Monitoring; Tall buildings; Tunnels; Wheels; Wi-Fi; Bi-directional communication; Blind hoisting; Internet of Things (IOT); Internet of things technologies; Large scale infrastructures; Safety management; Safety monitoring system; Underground construction; Cranes","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056508559"

However, the security and privacy problems in CPS have not been properly addressed, e.g., the monitored source location can be inferred by an attacker, which can substantially undermine the reliability of CPS. Unfortunately, the existing techniques to protect against the leakage of the source location do not achieve an acceptable balance among the source location privacy, transmission delay, and energy consumption to guarantee high reliability. To address this issue, we propose an attacker location evaluation-based fake source scheduling (FSSE) for source location privacy in CPS to enhance the privacy level and maintain the system performance. The proposed FSSE contains two main phases. The first, backbone construction, is dependent on the probability of capture derived from the communication information of self and neighboring nodes. This phase aims to build a backbone to form a baseline with respect to the source location privacy and transmission delay. The second phase is fake message scheduling, which is established to provide a trade-off among privacy, transmission delay, and communication overhead in terms of the hypothesized location of the attacker by using stochastic processes. Through analysis and simulation, we demonstrate that the proposed method has a more stable privacy level and more efficient transmission delay and energy consumption than the three compared algorithms, i.e., phantom routing, tree-based diversionary routing, and dynamic fake source selection. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","attacker location evaluation; backbone construction; Cyber-physical systems; fake source scheduling; first-passage time; source location privacy","Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Random processes; Scheduling; Stochastic systems; Analysis and simulation; attacker location evaluation; Communication overheads; Cyber-Physical System (CPS); Fake sources; First passage time; Security and privacy; Source-location privacy; Location","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055189517"

In many cases, information collection in CPS is provided through a group of distributed sensors and all of them change continuously with time. Thus the sensor information is usually in the form of time series. One particularly interesting application in time series analysis is use of complex networks to represent and study behaviors of system. Complex networks has been playing an important role for analyzing complex systems as it helps understanding the topology structure of systems with different interacting units. In this paper, we proposed a reliable method for constructing complex networks from multivariate time series (MTSs) in the cases of single and multisensor based on information geometry theory, which allows the information in the time series to be extracted by analyzing the associated complex network. We first estimate covariance matrices and then a geodesic-based distance between the covariance matrices is introduced. Consequently, the network can be constructed on a Riemannian manifold where the nodes and edges correspond to the covariance matrix and the geodesic-based distance, respectively. The proposed method provides us with a nonlinear relationship and intrinsic geometry viewpoint to understand the MTSs and also an alternative approach to fuse, model, represent, and visualize the multisensor data in CPS. A number of experimental studies and numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the generality and the effectiveness of our approach with both synthetic and real datasets. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Complex networks; information geometry; time series","Automobile engine manifolds; Computation theory; Covariance matrix; Embedded systems; Geodesy; Geometry; Harmonic analysis; Measurement; Sensors; Time series; Time series analysis; Covariance matrices; Cyber-Physical System (CPS); Information collections; Information geometry; Multivariate time series; Network construction; Non-linear relationships; Tightly coupled integration; Complex networks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031782829"

We consider choreographies as the ground formal model allowing a developer to describe and specify peers coordination as a set of conversations, i.e., all sequences of messages exchanged between the communicating peers. Proceeding this way does not require building the individual peers, nor their composition; they may be obtained by choreography projection. The correctness of the preservation of such messages exchanges by each peer obtained after projection is a key issue, known as the realizability problem. In our previous work [1], we have proposed a set of composition operators allowing designers to build realizable choreographies that are represented by conversation protocols (CPs). We rely on the correct-by-construction Event-B method to prove that each CP constructed using our operators is realizable.

This article presents an industrial Internet of things (IIoT) context-aware information system that provides decision support for mobile or static operators and supervisors. The system uniquely combines key IIoT concepts such as multi-layered, service-oriented architecture, which integrates several subsystems, such as sensor data acquisition together with concepts for developing context-aware systems such as context modelling and contextual data information provision. The proposed solution is relevant for several manufacturing environments. However, in dynamic, semi-structured manufacturing environments that the workstations are not fixed but dynamically change over time and in which the workers are mobile and not static to some predefined workstations, the utilisation of context-aware information delivery is considered as even more relevant.

Industrial requirements were gathered and led to use cases for a customised implementation of the proposed solution into a shipyard. The proposed solution includes a number of context-aware apps that support the users in carrying out production tasks.

Most existing work on real-time data retrieval assumes that the real-time data under study are always available, and the developed scheduling algorithms mainly focus on making real-time decisions while meeting the temporal validity (freshness) constraints. This assumption, however does not hold in many real-life CPS applications with intermittent data availability, such as in energy harvesting-based sensing systems. In this paper, we study the multi-interval availability-constrained fresh data retrieval (MAFDR) problem, which aims to retrieve all required real-time data on time for a set of decision tasks while taking both the temporal validity and data availability constraints into consideration. We present the formulation of the MAFDR problem and study its complexity under different settings. For the scenario of single decision task with unit-size data retrieval time, we propose a polynomial-time optimal data retrieval algorithm, which comprises a task finish time selection phase and an optimal retrieval schedule construction phase. For the general scenario of multiple decision tasks with nonunit-size data retrieval time, we provide an integer linear programming formulation for the MAFDR problem and propose a fast heuristic algorithm based on max flow. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms has been validated through extensive experiments by comparing to the optimal solution and the state-of-the-art approach. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyber-physical systems (CPSs); data availability; data freshness; real-time data retrieval; sensor network","Data structures; Decision making; Embedded systems; Energy harvesting; Heuristic algorithms; Information retrieval; Integer programming; Interactive computer systems; Job analysis; Polynomial approximation; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Search engines; Sensor networks; Sensors; Cyber-Physical System (CPS); Data availability; Data freshness; Fast heuristic algorithms; Integer Linear Programming; Real-time data; State-of-the-art approach; Task analysis; Real time systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050405635"

The effective detection of malapps is an emerging yet crucial task. How to establish relationships among malapps, discover their potential communities, and explore their evolution process has become a challenging issue in effective detection of malapps. To deal with this issue, in this work, we are motivated to propose an automated community detection method for Android malapps by building a relation graph based on their static features. First, we construct a large feature set to profile the behaviors of malapps. Second, we propose an E-N algorithm for graph construction by combining epsilon graph and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) graph. It solves the problem of an incomplete graph led by epsilon method and the problem of noise generated by k-NN graph. Finally, a community detection method, Infomap, is employed to explore the underlying structures of the relation graph, and obtain the communities of malapps. We evaluate our community detection method with 3996 malapp samples.

Technically, for a given pattern automaton, we present a construction of a Moore machine that works as a filter. The construction is automata-theoretic, and we find the use of Moore machines particularly suited for embedded applications, not only because their sequential operation is relatively cheap but also because they are amenable to hardware acceleration by dedicated circuits. We prove soundness (i.e., absence of lost matches), too. We work in two settings: In the untimed one, a pattern is an NFA; in the timed one, a pattern is a timed automaton. The extension of our untimed construction to the timed setting is technically involved, but our experiments demonstrate its practical benefits. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Filtering; monitoring; Moore machine; real-time system; timed automaton (TA); timed pattern matching","Embedded systems; Filtration; Finite automata; Interactive computer systems; Job analysis; Monitoring; Pattern matching; Pipeline processing systems; Sequential machines; Automata; Moore machines; Remote monitoring; Search problem; Task analysis; Timed Automata; Real time systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050238852"

These systems pose a significant challenge in meeting Time-to-Market due to the ever more challenging requirements such as ultra-low latency for mission-critical applications, extremely high throughput demanding tons of communication and computation resources working concurrently, and, at the same time, low power consumption and small chip area for its field deployment. This paper presents three actor-oriented design patterns for a systematic creation of implementation-aware performance models of complex real-time wireless communication systems that can be applied in existing system level frameworks. The main benefits of this modeling approach are: 1) Time semantic model correctness where the effects of a chosen hardware platform can be taken into account. 2) Behavioral modeling completeness by construction, and 3) reduced time-to-market through reduced modeling effort, improved maintainability and testability. Furthermore, by adhering to this modeling paradigm, it is possible to easily integrate the following features for the improvement of functional safety: a) system timing diagnostics, b) an appropriate handling of timing violations, and c) a simulation-based sched-uleability analysis. To demonstrate the aforementioned benefits, a model of a real world pre-5G baseband processor for V2X communications is created in Intel CoFluent where our claims are confirmed when assessing real-time deadline compliance of possible HW implementations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Actor-oriented modeling; Cyber-physical Systems; Embedded Systems; ESL; Executable specification; Performance modeling; Real-time; Simulation; System Level Modeling; Wireless communication","Commerce; Concurrent engineering; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Semantics; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Actor-oriented models; Executable specifications; Performance Model; Real time; Simulation; System-level modeling; Wireless communications; Real time systems","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058224440"

Failing to locate these agents and predict their possible future actions may result in serious safety hazards. Traditionally, the responsibility for avoiding these safety hazards is solely on the drivers. With improved sensor quantity and quality, modern ADAS systems are able to accurately perceive the location and speed of other nearby vehicles and warn the driver about potential safety hazards. However, accurately predicting the behavior of a driver remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a framework in which behavioral models of drivers (Digital Behavioral Twins) are shared among connected cars to predict potential future actions of neighboring vehicles, therefore improving the safety of driving. We provide mathematical formulations of models of driver behavior and the environment, and discuss challenging problems during model construction and risk analysis. We also demonstrate that our digital twins framework can accurately predict driver behaviors and effectively prevent collisions using a case study in a virtual driving simulation environment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification; Connected cars; Markov decision processes; Modeling methodologies","Behavioral research; Classification (of information); Forecasting; Hazards; Markov processes; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Virtual reality; Connected cars; Driving simulation; Markov Decision Processes; Mathematical formulation; Model construction; Modeling methodology; Potential safety hazards; Social activities; Automobile safety devices","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056832496"

A small mistake in the main server will result in data loss, which is irreversible and fatal. Blockchain technique combines the dispersed data with mutual backup and retrieval mechanism, which guarantees that the data cannot be tampered with and forged privately.

Synthesis aids the controller designer by automating this process once the controller's specification and the dynamics of the environment have been formalized. Most classes of system dynamics have undecidable synthesis problems, which is commonly mitigated by computing a discrete abstraction of the system dynamics and synthesizing a controller that works correctly under all environment behaviors captured by the abstraction. Abstractions can be made at varying levels of granularity. If the granularity is too fine, the abstraction grows too large to be suitable for current synthesis approaches. If the granularity is too coarse, it is insufficient for computing a controller that satisfies the specification. In this paper, we present a new abstraction computation process that facilitates working with coarser abstractions in synthesis while retaining the controllability of the system. Our approach takes a fine-grained abstraction and processes it to a coarser abstraction in which the controller is only offered actions that minimize the amount of non-determinism in the abstraction. We demonstrate that our approach helps to find a good balance between precision and controllability in CPS controller synthesis on two case studies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052582527"

As energy becomes a necessity for our modern living, effective management of Smart Grid can have great impact on power services. Recent smart meter technology has provided an opportunity that allows an economic model of utility to be more flexible and optimal. Construction of such a model requires better understanding of consumer behaviors in response to a given pricing. Most existing research uses mathematical models that tend to rely on assumptions that may not be realistically realizable. Majority of empirical work aims to predict or optimize utility loads. To the best of our knowledge, no empirical published work has addressed this issue. Our research aims to find an appropriate Big data analytic approach to learning consumption pattern of each household at appliance level. Particularly, this paper investigates how machine learning can be used to predict the change of customer's consumption habits for lower pricing.

This article studies a novel localization system to achieve an acceptable accuracy position using received signal strength indicator for harsh environments like construction. Based on analysis of the targets’ behavior pattern, we first use curve fitting to filter the distance derived from received signal strength indicator.

Data aggregation is an efficient technique to conserve energy by reducing the amount of transmission data. To optimize real-time communication under constraints of power consumption and data aggregation performance of each node in CPS, this paper presents a learning automata (LA)-based degree-bounded bottleneck data aggregation tree (DBBDAT) construction framework to minimize the maximum delay on data aggregation trees with bounded degree, which is an NP-hard problem. We model the network of CPS as a connected weighted and directed graph to form a network of LA. Degree-bounded data aggregation trees are constructed first by the action selection of each automaton. Then, the action vector of each automaton is updated by linear reward-inaction learning algorithm, and at last DBBDAT is constructed based on a threshold. Simulation results show that our approach significantly outperforms integer linear programming (ILP)-based method in terms of time complexity. Compared with ILP-based method, it can obtain an optimal solution or a suboptimal solution with guaranteed approximation ratios, and can control the tradeoff between accuracy and cost by choosing appropriate learning rate and threshold. Its distributed implementation is simple and it can efficiently solve the problem for the sparse graph in practice. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyber-physical system (CPS); data aggregation tree; energy-efficient; learning automata (LA); real-time","Automata theory; Complex networks; Computational complexity; Directed graphs; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Forestry; Integer programming; Learning algorithms; Optimization; Real time systems; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Data aggregation tree; Distributed implementation; Guaranteed approximation ratios; Integer Linear Programming; Learning automaton; Real-time communication; Suboptimal solution; Trees (mathematics)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954054690"

Buildings can be considered as connected cyber-physical systems that require the construction of sound methodologies inherited from the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) research. In particular, aiming at autonomous buildings, the effective design of renewable energy sources is a key aspect for which such methodologies have to be developed. In this work, we propose a modeling strategy for the early estimation of the performance of photovoltaic (PV) arrays. Although a plethora of PV panel models there exists, most of these models suffer from accuracy/complexity tradeoffs. On one hand, building fast models forces to ignore either the correlation between temperature and irradiance, or the topology of panels, thus yielding inaccurate estimations. On the other, more accurate models are time consuming and require costly measurements or circuit analysis, that cannot be extracted from the sole datasheet. This paper proposes a compact semi-empirical model, suitable for real time simulation and built solely from information derived from the PV panel datasheet. The model is built by empirically fitting an expression of the panel operating point as a function of both irradiance and temperature, and of the adopted PV system topology. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed model have been validated w.r.t. the production traces of the PV systems of a real world industrial building. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Architectural design; Computer aided design; Computer aided software engineering; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Office buildings; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Smart city; Topology; Zero energy buildings; Effective designs; Industrial buildings; Modeling strategy; Operating points; Photovoltaic arrays; Real time simulations; Renewable energy source; Semi-empirical modeling; Structural design","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057100507"

Four core techniques embodied in the framework are illustrated in detail as follows: (1) real-time acquisition, organization, and management of the physical assembly shop-floor data, (2) construction of the assembly shop-floor digital twin, (3) digital twin and big data-driven prediction of the assembly shop-floor, and (4) digital twin-based assembly shop-floor production management and control service. To elaborate how to apply the proposed approach to reality, we present detailed implementation process of the proposed digital twin-based smart production management and control approach in a satellite assembly shop-floor scenario.

CPS have to adapt online to the changing nature of the physical environment; this may require the online modification of their system model, but any change should preserve correct operation. Correctness by construction relies on using formal tools, which suffer from a considerable computational overhead. As the current system model of a CPS may adapt to the environment, the new system model must be verified before its execution to ensure that the properties are preserved. However, CPS development has mainly concentrated on the design-time aspects, existing only few contributions that address their online adaptation. We research on the pros and cons of formal tools to support dynamic changes at runtime. We formalize the semantics of the adaptation logic of an autonomic manager (OLIVE) that performs online verification for a specific application, a dynamic virtualized server system.

In that context, the present work aims to investigate how, and in which form, a Cyber-Physical System (CPS), one of many different but complementary technologies associated with the future of manufacturing, could be employed in the Construction industry. Recognizing that the core of CPS should be the dynamics of construction processes, the initial focus is in how to develop Process Data Models (virtual) that could communicate with Product Data Models (BIM models), and receive/send data in almost real-time from/for the existent hardware (sensors and actuators) in the physical production processes. This article present some preliminary work based on the standardized methodology of IDM/MVD, which are part of the buildingSMART solution for interoperability along with Industry Foundation Class (IFC) data schema. The proposed methodology considers an IDM modelled in Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN) language in such detail as to expose the workflow of production. The contribution in this context is in mapping production processes in BPMN notation into Petri Nets (PN) semantics. Petri Nets are an adequate model to construction processes, with precise semantics and largely used in the simulation of discrete events.

Under the slogan of differentiable programming, there is an increasing demand for efficient automatic gradient computation for emerging network architectures that incorporate dynamic control flow, especially in NLP. In this paper we propose an implementation of backpropagation using functions with callbacks, where the forward pass is executed as a sequence of function calls, and the backward pass as a corresponding sequence of function returns. A key realization is that this technique of chaining callbacks is well known in the programming languages community as continuation-passing style (CPS). Any program can be converted to this form using standard techniques, and hence, any program can be mechanically converted to compute gradients. Our approach achieves the same flexibility as other reverse-mode automatic differentiation (AD) techniques, but it can be implemented without any auxiliary data structures besides the function call stack, and it can easily be combined with graph construction and native code generation techniques through forms of multi-stage programming, leading to a highly efficient implementation that combines the performance benefits of define-then-run software frameworks such as TensorFlow with the expressiveness of define-by-run frameworks such as PyTorch. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Backpropagation; Deep learning; Network architecture; Automatic differentiations; Auxiliary data structures; Continuation-passing style; Efficient implementation; Gradient computation; Multi-stage programming; Performance benefits; Software frameworks; Automatic programming","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064824211"

Given the pressure of labor costs and fierce competition, there is a tremendous shortage of autonomous and intelligent robots and cyber-physical systems with the ability of perception and decision in coming Industry 4.0 application. These intelligent robots are able to analyze their tasks by selecting appropriate tools, planning their movements and executing suitable operations, in the same way as a trained human worker would do. In this paper, an industrial robot UR5 is allowed to perceive, locate and interact with different objects such as tools and office supplies. Using a stereo vision camera, it is possible to obtain both RGB- and Depth-data of the robots surrounding and workspace. This data is fed into a Deep Learning Faster-RCNN Network to realize the recognition and localization of present objects out of 50 different classes. With the derived information, proper operations can be planed and executed. The experimental results prove a successful recognition and gripping of reachable objects in the robot’s workspace or suitable feedback for unreachable objects. This work confirms the possibility of using current Deep Learning algorithms in combination with industrial robots to build intelligent systems. The configuration will become increasingly useful for automation and assembly technologies in upcoming Industry 4.0 applications with further developed hardware and software algorithms.

A blockchain is essentially a distributed database of records or public ledger of all transactions or digital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties. Each transaction in the public ledger is verified by consensus of a majority of the participants in the system. And, once entered, information can never be erased. Based on that, this paper presents description of cryptographic hash-functions in the transaction block chain system. In the paper the author shows the feasibility of using transaction blocks in distributed database and gives description of the consensus plots. As a base of cryptographic side, the author described Merkle-Damgard construction as a method of building collision-resistant cryptographic hash functions from collision-resistant one-way compression functions. This construction was used in the design of many popular hash algorithms and interesting for us SHA. This algorithm can be used to generate digests of messages. The digests are used to detect whether messages have been changed since the digests were generated. Moreover in the paper is highlighted methods for support of monitoring systems integrity.

The device enables the user to act as an active node in the built-environment's underlying Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network, thereby permitting a more immediate and intuitive relationship between the user and his/her environment, where this latter is integrated with physical / computational adaptive systems and services. Two main resulting advantages are identified and illustrated. On the one hand, the device's sensors provide personal (i.e., body temperature / humidity, physical activity) as well as immediate environmental (i.e., personal-space air-quality) data to the built-environment's embedded / ambulant systems. Moreover, rotaries on the device enable the user to override automatically established illumination and ventilation settings in order to accommodate user-preferences. On the other hand, the built-environment's systems provide notifications and feedback with respect to their status to the device, thereby raising user-awareness of the state of his/her surroundings and corresponding interior environmental conditions. In this manner, the user becomes a context-aware node in a Cyber-Physical System.

Virtual commissioning allows the programmer to test the control logic before the real hardware is available and results in a reduction of the ramp-up time. In addition, the availability of a virtual model eases quality improvement, condition monitoring, virtual training, etc. The lack of integration with other tools and uniformity in file formats is an important issue that limits the use of virtual commissioning, due to a high effort and in-depth knowledge for the construction of the digital model. This paper gives an overview of academic research on the reduction of this modelling effort. A summary of different virtual commissioning approaches is given, which points out the potential of virtual commissioning using a virtual twin. Main advantages are a reduction of commissioning time and improvement of quality. These benefits where tested by performing a small scale experiment. Results show a similar effect as found in literature.

At runtime these systems collaborate with each other to achieve goals that a single system could not achieve on its own. For example, autonomous vehicles can dynamically form convoys at runtime to facilitate higher traffic throughput and a reduction in CO2 emissions. While the importance of context documentation and analysis in system development is well known, current model-based engineering approaches struggle with the size and complexity of cyber-physical systems’ contexts. This is due to high variety and dynamicity of the contexts to be considered. For example, a convoy to be formed at runtime may consist of different numbers of participating vehicles. Additionally, it may face different neighboring, not partaking context systems (e.g., non-equipped vehicles, equipped but not participating vehicles) and situations (e.g., speed limits, road construction sites, emergency vehicles). This paper proposes a context ontology to cope with highly dynamic contexts of cyber-physical systems by explicitly differentiating between not only the system and its context but also between the cyber-physical system network the system participates in, as well as the system network’s context. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Collaborative Systems; Context; Context Modeling; Cyber-physical Systems; Dynamic Context","Dynamics; Embedded systems; Ontology; Software design; Vehicles; CO2 emissions; Context modeling; Context ontology; Current modeling; Dynamic contexts; Road construction site; Speed limit; System development; Cyber Physical System","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051027420"

They consist of many distributed components cooperating to provide increasingly complex functionality. The design and development of such a system is difficult and error-prone. To help engineers overcome these challenges we created a formal, scenario-based specification language. Short scenarios, i.e., event sequences, specify requirements and the desired behaviors by describing how components may, must, or must not behave. Scenarios provide an intuitive way for creating formal assume-guarantee (GR(1)) specifications, giving engineers easy access to simulation, for validating the specified behavior, and controller synthesis, for creating controller software which is correct by construction. In this paper we present an approach for generating Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) code from a scenario-based specification. Previous code generation efforts, including our own, created large, verbose source files causing some tools, e.g., compilers or editors, to perform slowly or even become unresponsive. Our new approach creates compact files, shifting significant amounts of code from executable instructions to data, to reduce the burden on the compiler and other tools. The generated code is efficient and introduces minimal to no latency between the occurrence of an event and the system's reaction to it. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","assume-guarantee specification; code generation; controller synthesis; programmable logic controller; scenarios","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050378697"

Drilling automation tomorrow is all about exploiting the current state of technologies available to the entire operation of drilling a well. Not only can drilling automation limit costs and reduce the risk to rig personnel and the environment, but they also give access to locations of considerable potential that previously have been regarded unsafe or uneconomical to operate in. There are however some challenges in keeping up with the ever-increasing pace of the development. For one, testing of novel and innovative solutions is often very expensive because of non-productive rig time during implementation, trial runs and data evaluation. Also, the modern technologies require extensive R&D before on-site testing can even commence. While on land-rigs, some of these costs and risks can be greatly minimized, many offshore solutions lack that luxury. This paper presents an overview of the design principles that go into the construction of a fully autonomous laboratory-scale drilling rig at the University of Stavanger. It aims at describing 1) the engineering principles involved to resemble full-scale drilling operations on the laboratory scale, 2) design considerations and components, 3) component requirements for the rig, 4) control system algorithms for real-time optimization of drilling parameters and detection and handling of drilling anomalies, 5) development of drilling models (drill string dynamics, bit-vibration, etc.) and 6) benefits and future work with the laboratory-scale system.

By preserving dependent types through each compiler pass, we could preserve source-level specifications and correctness proofs into the generated target-language programs. Unfortunately, type-preserving compilation of dependent types is hard. In 2002, Barthe and Uustalu showed that type-preserving CPS is not possible for languages such as Coq. Specifically, they showed that for strong dependent pairs (Σ types), the standard typed call-by-name CPS is not type preserving. They further proved that for dependent case analysis on sums, a class of typed CPS translationsDincluding the standard translationDis not possible. In 2016, Morrisett noticed a similar problem with the standard call-by-value CPS translation for dependent functions (Π types). In essence, the problem is that the standard typed CPS translation by double-negation, in which computations are assigned types of the form (A → ⊥) → ⊥, disrupts the term/type equivalence that is used during type checking in a dependently typed language. In this paper, we prove that type-preserving CPS translation for dependently typed languages is not not possible.We develop both call-by-name and call-by-value CPS translations from the Calculus of Constructions with both Π and σ types (CC) to a dependently typed target language, and prove type preservation and compiler correctness of each translation. Our target language is CC extended with an additional equivalence rule and an additional typing rule, which we prove consistent by giving a model in the extensional Calculus of Constructions. Our key observation is that we can use a CPS translation that employs answer-type polymorphism, where CPS-translated computations have type Aα.(A → α) → α. This type justifies, by a free theorem, the new equality rule in our target language and allows us to recover the term/type equivalences that CPS translation disrupts. Finally, we conjecture that our translation extends to dependent case analysis on sums, despite the impossibility result, and provide a proof sketch. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CPS; Dependent types; Parametricity; Secure compilation; Type theory; Type-preserving compilation","Calculations; Program compilers; Theorem proving; Dependent types; Parametricity; Secure compilation; Type preserving compilation; Type theory; Translation (languages)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049589247"

This process is labor-intensive, error-prone, and heavily reliant on the knowledge and experience of the decision makers as well as the quality and reliability of the available information. Cyber-physical systems (CPS) offer the potential to transform traditional data collection approach and strengthen the coordination between cyber models and physical assets in a construction project. This paper describes a knowledge-based CPS architecture that aims at augmenting human decision making in construction. Domain knowledge, such as site policies, safety rules, and workflow logic, is elicited and compiled in an ontology-based knowledge hub. With the support of bi-directional cyber-physical communication, the knowledge hub inquiries relevant data from cyber models and physical assets, integrates real-time project data, and synthesizes context-specific information to facilitate human decision-making. This paper outlines the key challenges and technical requirements for creating the knowledge hub and its linkages with traditional CPS systems.

However, the traditional light-based single-function emergency signage may lead occupants to a fire blocked route or a crowded exit resulting in a delayed evacuation and even more serious situation during an emergency evacuation. A cyber-physical systems (CPS) approach is expected to improve effective integration of event monitoring, real-time information communication, proactive danger identification, and intelligent guidance. This paper proposed a cyber-physical systems approach as a real-time emergency evacuation signage guidance system to guide occupants towards safe and fast evacuation routes considering fire source location and development trends, and human traffic flow trends in real time. The proposed system includes a fire detection sensor network system monitoring fire source and propagation, an occupant sensor network system evaluating the existing occupant traffic flow, and intelligent exit signage systems showing fire-free and crowd-free route directions. All fire detection sensor units communicate with each other to broadcast the danger location information. The occupant sensor network system detects the traffic flow coming in and going out for each direction, and detects and predicts crowd areas based on the traffic flow trends. The effective integration of computational resources (such as wireless sensors, real-time monitoring, data fusion, and prediction) with the building evacuation process will improve the evacuation performance. The opportunity offered by the adoption of a cyber-physical systems approach to make the evacuation process more intelligent and sustainable is discussed and the key benefits highlighted. The expected results would be the reduction of evacuation time and risk to encounter into fatal hazard areas with the installed intelligent signage guidance system, and eventually would be improvement of building evacuation performance and reduction of human injuries and fatalities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Air navigation; Building components; Cyber Physical System; Data fusion; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Embedded systems; Fire detectors; Fires; Intelligent buildings; Monitoring; Real time systems; Remote control; Sensor networks; Building emergency evacuations; Computational resources; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Cyber-Physical System (CPS); Emergency evacuation; Real time monitoring; Real-time information; Sensor network systems; Emergency traffic control","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048662807"

Critical observability corresponds to the possibility of detecting if the current state of an FSM is in a given region of interest, called set of critical states. A critical observer detects on-line the occurrence of critical states. When a large-scale network of FSMs is considered, the construction of such an observer is prohibitive because of the large computational effort needed. We propose a decentralized architecture for critical observers of networks of FSMs, where on-line detection of critical states is performed by local critical observers, each associated with an FSM of the network, which do not need to interact. For the efficient design of decentralized critical observers we first extend on-the-fly algorithms traditionally used in the community of formal methods for the verification and control design of FSMs. We then extend to networks of FSMs, bisimulation theory traditionally given in the community of formal methods for single FSMs. The proposed techniques provide a remarkable computational complexity reduction, as discussed throughout the paper and also demonstrated by means of illustrative examples. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bisimulation equivalence; Critical observability; Decentralized observers; Network of finite state machines","Image segmentation; Observability; Safety engineering; Bisimulation equivalences; Computational complexity reductions; Computational effort; Decentralized architecture; Decentralized observers; Large-scale network; On-the-fly algorithms; Safety critical applications; Formal methods","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029443703"

During deployment, the nodes of an industrial wireless network can be deployed in only some specific regions due to physical environment restrictions in the factory; thus, occlusions are not always effectively circumvented and network performance is reduced. Therefore, this article focuses on the layout problem of the industrial backhaul network: a WiFi long-distance, multi-hop network. The optimization objectives were network throughput and construction cost, and the network delay was used as a constraint. For small networks, we propose a hierarchical traversal method to obtain the optimal solution, whereas for a large network, we used a hierarchical heuristic method to obtain an approximate solution, and for extremely large networks, we used a parallel interactive local search algorithm based on dynamic programming. Then, if the original network layout cannot meet the transmission demands due to traffic bursts, we propose a network bandwidth recovery method based on the Steiner tree to recover the network’s performance.

The framework utilizes the model driven engineering paradigm to define a domain specific development environment that allows the control engineer, a) to transform the mechanical units of the plant to Industrial Automation Things (IAT), i.e., to IoT-compliant manufacturing cyber-physical components, and, b) to specify the cyber components, which implement the plant processes, as physical mashups, i.e., compositions of plant services provided by IATs. The UML4IoT profile is extended to address the requirements of the framework. The approach was successfully applied on a laboratory case study to demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of flexibility and responsiveness. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyber-physical systems; Internet of Things; IoT mashups; Manufacturing CPS; Model driven engineering; Service composition; UML4IoT","Factory automation; Requirements engineering; Smart manufacturing; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber physicals; Cyber-physical systems; IoT mashup; Manufacturing CPS; Mash up; Mashups; Model-driven Engineering; Services composition; UML4IoT; Office automation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046061584"

The deep coupling and continuous interaction between such processes lead to a significant increase in complexity in the design and implementation of CPSs. Consequently, whereas developing CPSs from scratch is inefficient, developing them with the aid of CPS run-time sup-porting platforms can be efficient. In recent years, much research has been actively conducted on CPS run-time supporting plat-forms. However, few surveys have been conducted on these platforms. In this paper, we analyze and evaluate existing CPS run-time supporting platforms by first classifying them into three categories from the viewpoint of software architecture: com-ponent-based platforms, service-based platforms, and agent-based platforms. Then, for each type, we detail its design philosophy, key technical problems, and corresponding solutions with specific use cases. Subsequently, we compare existing platforms from two aspects: construction approaches for CPS tasks and support for non-functional properties. Finally, we outline several im-portant future research issues. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agent; Component; Cyber physical system (CPS); Run-time supporting platforms; Service","Agents; Embedded systems; Software agents; Surveys; Component; Construction approaches; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Design and implementations; Non functional properties; Service; Supporting platform; Cyber Physical System","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038212241"

A major limitation of P2P live streaming is that playout rates are constrained by clients’ upstream capacities – typically much lower than downstream capacities – which limit the quality of the delivered stream. To leverage P2P architectures without sacrificing quality, CPs must commit additional resources to complement clients’ resources. In this work, we propose a cloud-based service AngelCast that enables CPs to complement P2P streaming. By subscribing to AngelCast, a CP is able to deploy extra resources (angel), on-demand from the cloud, to maintain a desirable stream quality. Angels do not download the whole stream, nor are they in possession of it. Rather, angels only relay the minimal fraction of the stream necessary to achieve the desired quality. We provide a lower bound on the minimum angel capacity needed to maintain a desired client bit-rate, and develop a fluid model construction to achieve it. Realizing the limitations of the fluid model construction, we design a practical multi-tree construction that captures the spirit of the optimal construction, and avoids its limitations. We present a prototype implementation of AngelCast, along with experimental results confirming the feasibility of our service. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cloud computing; Content delivery; Live streaming; P2P","Cloud computing; Distributed computer systems; Forestry; Video streaming; Content delivery; Content providers; Live streaming; Optimal construction; P2P architecture; Peer-to-peer architectures; Prototype implementations; Tree construction; Peer to peer networks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029406106"

Existing traffic flow analysis methods lack the ability to understand cascading effect of congestions and how to improve overall resilience in greater areas. Dependency risk graphs have been proposed as a tool for analyzing such cascading failures using infrastructure dependency chains. In this paper, we propose a risk-based interdependency analysis methodology capable to detect large-scale traffic congestions between interconnected junctions of the road network and provide mitigation solutions to increase traffic flow resilience. Dependency risk chains of junctions provide important information about which junctions are affected when other major junctions are congested in the road transportation network. Targeted mitigation mechanisms for traffic congestion can be proposed and the causes of bottlenecks can be analyzed to introduce road constructions or reparations with the best possible results in relieving traffic. We applied the proposed methodology on data collected by the UK government using cyber-physical traffic sensors over the course of 6 years. Our tool analyzed the UK major/A road transportation network, detected n-order junction dependencies and automatically proposed specific mitigation solutions to increase the overall resilience of the road infrastructure network. Simulation results indicate that detected mitigation options, if applied, can increase overall congestion resilience in wider areas of the network up to 12% by lowering likelihood of congestion. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyber-physical systems; Graph analysis; Risk assessment; Traffic congestion mitigation; Transportation infrastructure","Chains; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Large scale systems; Motor transportation; Network security; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Roads and streets; Traffic control; Transportation; Transportation routes; Congestion mitigation; Graph analysis; Interconnected junctions; Interdependency analysis; Road infrastructures; Road transportation networks; Traffic flow analysis; Transportation infrastructures; Traffic congestion","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041422742"

Machine learning techniques and cyber-physical systems are closely related to realize a new thinking of production management and factory transformation. Textual data collected in machinery logs or product documentation, does not exhibit a rich structure which can be easily understandable by both humans and machines. Therefore, data in an unstructured format needs to be enriched and transformed into a representation schema that exhibits a higher degree of structure, before it can be used and shared. The paper, introduces a novel conceptual framework to create knowledge representations from unstructured data sources, based on enriched Semantic Vectors, using a classical vector space model extended with ontological support. Hence, this research explores how traditional knowledge representations can be enriched through incorporation of implicit information derived from the complex relationships (i.e., semantic associations) modelled by domain ontologies with the addition of information presented in documents, addresses the challenges concerning data exchange and its understanding within Industry 4.0 scenarios, when supported by semantic technologies.

Despite the development of lightweight and high-speed laser scanners, the complicated measurement procedure and long measurement time are still heavy burdens for widespread use of laser scanning. To solve these problems, a robotic 3D scanning system using multiple robots has been proposed. This system, named CPS-SLAM, consists of a parent robot with a 3D laser scanner and child robots with target markers. A large-scale 3D model is acquired by an on-board 3D laser scanner on the parent robot from several positions determined precisely by a localization technique, named the Cooperative Positioning System (CPS), that uses multiple robots. Therefore, this system can build a 3D model without complicated post-processing procedures such as ICP. In addition, this system is an open-loop SLAM system and a very precise 3D model can be obtained without closed loops. This paper proposes an automatic planning technique for a laser measurement by using CPS-SLAM. Planning a proper scanning strategy depending on a target structure makes it possible to perform laser scanning efficiently and accurately even for a large-scale and complex environment. The proposed technique plans an efficient scanning strategy automatically by taking account of several criteria, such as visibility between robots, error accumulation, and efficient traveling. We conducted computer simulations and outdoor experiments to verify the performance of the proposed technique. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3D modeling; Automatic sensing planning; Laser measurement; Multiple robots","Digital storage; Industrial robots; Laser applications; Petrochemical plants; Reverse engineering; Robot programming; Robotics; Robots; Scanning; Surface analysis; 3-d modeling; Cooperative positioning systems; Laser measurements; Localization technique; Multiple robot; Post-processing procedure; Sensing planning; Three-dimensional model; Three dimensional computer graphics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84970002379"

We developed a shipyard simulator incorporating an optimization method to find the specific improvement points for ship construction. We then integrate this simulation system with a previously developed monitoring system using the monitored data as input data to the simulation. This integration enables a comparison of the real production process with the ideal process and allowed the generation of improvement points for the current process.

The degree of accidents, however, allows the conclusion that proper assessment and/or protection of excavation sites is not performed sufficiently in the field, or safety coordinators and/or adequately trained CPs are not on hand when needed.

Mobile cranes, as a central component of many construction operations, contribute to a large number of construction fatalities. While many of these fatalities are caused by inadequate planning, few of the mobile crane safety issues have been well addressed. Developments in information technologies, notably cyber-physical systems (CPS), are changing the way in which mobile crane planning can be done. With the capacity for bi-directional coordination between physical world components and their virtual representations, CPS offers advantages in monitoring mobile cranes in such a way as to facilitate effective planning, proactively monitor crane operations, provide rich multi-modal feedback to crane operators, and ultimately, to avoid mobile crane failures. This paper explores CPS applicability in planning mobile crane operations on construction sites. It reviews the key definitions and characteristics of CPS, current CPS applications in the built environment, potential benefits and barriers for CPS application to mobile cranes, and discusses how CPS application to the planning and operation of mobile crane uses can be achieved. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Construction; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Mobile crane planning","Accident prevention; Construction; Construction industry; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Construction fatalities; Construction operations; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Effective planning; Mobile cranes; Multimodal feedback; Potential benefits; Virtual representations; Cranes","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026886579"

Traditional building information, such as geometry, material or cost, can be represented based on the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), an open standard used for building information modeling (BIM). However, information representing cyber-physical systems cannot be fully described with the IFC standard. Focusing on CPS applications in structural health monitoring and control, this paper presents an extension of the current IFC schema, enabling BIM-based modeling of cyber-physical systems in compliance with the IFC standard. BIM-based, IFC-compliant CPS modeling facilitates the design process, the documentation, and the information exchange of cyber-physical systems. In this study, a semantic model is developed, serving as a technology-independent metamodel to formally describe cyber-physical systems deployed in structural health monitoring and control applications. Supporting BIM-based, IFC-compliant modeling of cyber-physical systems, the semantic model is mapped into the IFC schema.

As such, the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus standard has become widely used by the transportation sector for internal vehicle communications. The protocol ensures that high priority messages are pushed to preserve system functionality. As a lightweight standard for embedded real-time systems, multiple versions of CAN exist for implementation. Nonetheless, the same performance enhancing traits of the protocol leave a CAN network open for a variety of exploits, and it becomes a non-trivial effort to strengthen CAN security while maintaining the benefits afforded by the standard. The priority of performance in these systems makes it such that security solutions cannot be applied post system development. For example, wrapping messages with security header information has a direct impact on performance. Therefore, effective CAN security must be integrated within the base network design. To this end, formal methods, as mathematically defined relationships used in model construction, can be used to engineer such a solution. By defining CAN as a system of mathematical expressions, the standard can be formally validated to discern attack vectors. This research proposes formally defining the CAN standard using the temporal logic of actions (TLA) before translating the formal language into a model for use in a CORE network emulator. The goal is to determine the extent to which security research can be conducted through low-cost intermediaries. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Can bus; Cyber security design; Embedded systems; Formal methods; Operational assurance","Computation theory; Computer crime; Control system synthesis; Crashworthiness; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Fighter aircraft; Formal languages; Formal methods; Interactive computer systems; Network protocols; Real time systems; CAN bus; Computational components; Controller area networkbus; Cyber security; Embedded real time systems; Mathematical expressions; Operational assurance; Temporal logic of actions; Network security","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019007769"

Together with their closely related counterparts, Hoare monads, they provide the basis on which verification tools like F∗, Hoare Type Theory (HTT), and Ynot are built. We show that Dijkstra monads can be derived ""for free"" by applying a continuation-passing style (CPS) translation to the standard monadic definitions of the underlying computational effects. Automatically deriving Dijkstra monads in this way provides a correctby- construction and efficient way of reasoning about user-defined effects in dependent type theories. We demonstrate these ideas in EMF∗, a new dependently typed calculus, validating it via both formal proof and a prototype implementation within F∗. Besides equipping F∗ with a more uniform and extensible effect system, EMF∗ enables a novel mixture of intrinsic and extrinsic proofs within F∗. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dependent types; Effectful programming; Proof assistants; Verification","Calculations; Formal languages; Verification; Computational effects; Continuation-passing style; Correct-by-construction; Dependent type theory; Dependent types; Proof assistant; Prototype implementations; Weakest precondition; Computation theory","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015310389"
